# IS 310 final project proposal
=======

My topic of IS 310 final project is “How South Korea was mentioned in the Cold War era.” After WWII, South Korea and North Korea were founded under the Cold War.
There has been the war going still today, technically. By Korea’s geographical situation, I am sure the mood in Korea's peninsular was not warm. 
Then, how does Korea seen outside? At least someone says Korean War is a forgotten war, but the wars' influence continues today. 
Therefore, my project going to be “how’s often,” and “in which topic” did Korea mention in a newspaper and media.

Yes, I am Korean, and I heard several stories during the Cold War in South Korea. My grandfather entered Korean Air Force Academy 2 years after the Korean War, 
my mother lived the age of pre-democratized South Korea, my father finished the military draft as the Air Force Military Police, 
and I just finished my mandatory armed service two years ago. 
What I heard from my parents about the Cold War-era Korea is the era of development and darkness at the same time, 
the darkness from both Cold War conflict and McCarthyistic dictatorship. 
I want to figure out in data how outside of Korea actually saw events going on in Korea, and this is my pure interest.

The day I had a meeting with Professor, she gave me excellent examples and sources that visualized and sorted data. Two examples are from _ThePudding_, 
the website that visualized data from newspapers in the United States. 
One webpage the professor showed me is **[which countries were most mentioned in journalism]("https://pudding.cool/2018/12/countries/")** of the U.S. by a year since the 1900s. 
The webpage created a visual image of national flag lines that represent how frequently countries are mentioned in headlines. 
The images are really catchy to find out how often certain countries are mentioned on a headline, but unfortunately, 
I could not click for detail, only images exist. The second page is [A brief history of the past - 100 YEARS as told through the New York Times archives](/ "https://pudding.cool/2018/12/brief-history/"). 
The page describes and illustrates the frequency of most used words in news articles of the New York Times. As words get big, it mentioned more often, 
and if I click the words, the webpage provides an explanation with a graph that in which year does this word mentioned more than the other years. 
This page seems did a great job of ‘showing’ how certain events or words that relevant to history as data. I really enjoyed these two sources, 
and indeed my project going to be similar to the way _ThePudding_ presented, with less technical.

The methodology is using **New York Times APIs to get journal data. From the 1950s**, when Koreas were founded, **to the 1990s**, when the Cold War ended, 
I will be gathering articles that are related to **the word ‘Korea’ with other mostly mentioned words**. I said, ‘mostly mentioned words’ because it is almost impossible to read all the filtered articles one by one. 
Therefore, **with 10 years of range (like the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s…)**, I am going to **filter frequently used words to presume the most interest** of the newspaper that is relevant to Koreas, 
just as is _A brief history of the past - 100 YEARS as told through the New York Times_ archives did. Calculating frequency is easy, the word mentioned article is divided by a whole article of a given year range. 
Unfortunately, I have no skill to make a webpage (I used _Omeka_ last semester, but still, not sure about actually creating a website), so I plan to make a presentation instead of the actual webpage. 

This is my first time using an API, so I am planning to try the **New York Times APIs** for this week. 
I still figuring out how to actually clean and sort data by the API, so the schedule of my project may change, 
but I hope I can utilize New York Times APIs during March. Then, for the first two weeks of April, 
I want to actually filter out data from the articles and get the actual result from the cleaned and processed data (frequency of words in years). 
Probably, my project update presentation will finish during the data work. 
Next, I will focus on the explanation of data like connecting most mentioned words in the year 1950s with the actual historical event in Korea. 
I hope this final phase will be accomplished at least before the final presentation. 
Lastly, I will answer the questions mentioned in ‘Final Project’ that are due May 13.
