How Korea mentioned in media in Cold War era?
After the WWII, South Korea and North Korea founded under the Cold War.
There has been war going still today, technically
By Korea’s geographical situation, I am sure the mood in Korea peninsular was not warm
Then, how does Korea seen by outside? At least someone say Korean War is forgotten war, but the wars' influence continues today

Then, how’s often, and in which topic did Korea mentioned in a news paper and media?
