## GETting Data
====

New York Times article _Your Apps Know Where You Were Last Night, and They’re Not Keeping It Secret_ is one example of 'getting data' but without realizing it. By development of digital and informaiton technology, IT companies now gain broader access to data that seemed impossible to collect in real time. Google Map presented in the NYT article is one of them. This unexpected data collection is formed by digitization, "the process of changing from analog to digital form," like scanning paper or collecting location of device (Gartner, n.d.). The Google Map is one example that collect location data of Ms. Margin's daily route toward work place (school classroom), specific time to visiting doctor's office, and gym and Weight Watchers (VALENTINO-DeVRIES et al, 2018). The article gives me a sense of data collecting that happen without or unconciously in daily life, and data collection is one field that requires follow along with data ethics.

The exactly same experience happening to me, I suprise everytime gmail reports "This is your route in current timeline..." The message contains route that restaurants that I visited oftenly, and when I turn on Google Map and touch the place I visited, the application show message "You visited this place few days ago." I know this is quite horrofying, and Google Map's situation gives me a clear impression on data collection and privacy setting. Still, seems it is hard to find clear way to comfirming terms and services about data collecting because most descriptions of consents are complex and hard to comprehend, but simplification of consent would leaves a possibility of omitting neccessary detail of privacy consent (Nissenbaum, 2011). Overall, the article _Your Apps Know Where You Were Last Night, and They’re Not Keeping It Secret_ provides one possible data collection with unexpectation, and also provides idea of caution when collecting and gathering consent data.
