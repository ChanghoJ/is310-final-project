## Crowdsourcing Culture & Managing Metadata - DPLA
====

The website Digital Public Library of America provides one good example of 'tagging', or finding wanted data by metadata, data of data. When user input keyword in search bar, the DPLA returns results that depends on metadata of results. Each data are consist of multiple metadata like creator, Created Date
, partner, contributing institution, collection, publisher, type, format, url, Standardized Rights Statement, or rights. Personally, I think showing a metadata is very important for information search because search data with topic sometimes does not contains all information needed. Also, sometimes students are collecting data by multiple keywords for their tasks, such as searching journal article with main, narrow, and broad keywords about topic. Not only for academic fields, but metadata also important for entertainment, such as finding a favorite genre of movies. Overall, DLPA provides a great example of data with metadata, which commonly seen today as tags.

I read one example of data without metadata last semester in IS 101, the Library of Babel. It is library that contians all the knowledge of the Universe, but people cannot find their most desired knowledge because there are no way to search. Try it! https://libraryofbabel.info/ Also, I had opportunity to create a data archieve about COVID-19 as IS 101 project, by using Omeka website. My group's items have multiple tags or metadata like title, subject, description, creator, source, publisher, date, contributor, format, and language. The Omeka website's archieve pages are quite similar to the DPLA's metadata format, which I felt familiarity when exploring the Digital Public Library of America website. This is my group's website, you can see the data about COVID-19 fake news or misinformation. https://is101fall2021.web.illinois.edu/items/browse?collection=6&page=3
