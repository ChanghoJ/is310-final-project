Through lectures, demonstrations and discussions by authorities on the arts and traditions of Korea, China and Japan, it is anticipated that elements developed over 5,000 years of Korean culture will be explored and placed in proper context with the two other nations.   Hesung Chun Koh, director of the symposium, said: ''People consider Koreans part of east Asia and let it go at that. The uniqueness of Korea is most evident in its art. Korean music has from three to five beats and a strong emphasis on improvisation, whereas Japanese music has two to four beats and it is contained within a rigid structural form. Visual arts in Korea were originally like those of China, but in the 16th century they broke away and became more casual, informal and individualistic.

"  Canada's state-owned nuclear power company has signed a contract worth $535 million (United States) to build a nuclear power plant for the Korea Electric Power Corporation.   The deal culminates more than 10 years of sales efforts by Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. It will be the second Canadian reactor built in South Korea.   Officials said on Friday that the 700,000-kilowatt power plant, estimated to cost about $1 billion, would be built in Wolsong, 160 miles southeast of Seoul. It will be built next to the first Canadian reactor, which has been operating since 1983.    South Korea and Canada are each other's fifth-largest trading partners. Trade between the companies is expected to reach $4 billion in 1990.   The Korean power company, known as Kepco, has nine nuclear power plants in operation and two more under construction. The Government expects to have 50 nuclear plants in operation in the next 40 years.   A turbine generator for the new plant will be supplied by the General Electric Company, along with the Korea Heavy Industries and Construction Company, under a contract to be signed soon, officials said.

"  CLYDE HABERMAN    SEOUL, South Korea - As Pope John Paul II arrived last week on an 11-day swing across Asia, several dozen young men and women held a peaceful anti-Government demonstration in the offices of the National Council of Churches. The Protestant-led council, with 2.1 million members, is a frequent critic of South Korea's authoritarian Government. Its headquarters are commonly used to make a political point. Hardly anyone in Seoul was aware of this sit-in because such events are almost never reported in the highly regulated press. Nevertheless, the protest was a reminder that the churches have long been the chief organized opposition to successive governments possessing limited tolerance for free expression.    These have been desultory days for Korean churches, their human-rights voice muted during a period of introspection and what a Protestant clergyman called ''regrouping.'' Recent anti- Government activism has been largely expressed in the universities. Nearly daily student demonstrations have often led to rock-throwing and police tear-gas attacks. During last week's quiet sit-in at the church council, hundreds of students were battling policemen at two Seoul campuses, one only several hundred yards from a seminary where the Pope was celebrating mass. The student protests continued this weekend.",https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/06/weekinreview/a-quieter-christianity-in-south-korea.html,,CLYDE HABERMAN,4,4,The New York Times,[],"[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'South Korea', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'POPE', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Haberman, Clyde', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH', 'rank': 4, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT (1983)', 'rank': 5, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Christians and Christianity', 'rank': 6, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Church-State Relations', 'rank': 7, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Freedom and Human Rights', 'rank': 8, 'major': 'N'}]",1984-05-06T05:00:00+0000,article,Week in Review Desk,Week in Review,News,nyt://article/2241847b-a9c5-5512-8370-b85186ca4e1d,930,nyt://article/2241847b-a9c5-5512-8370-b85186ca4e1d,A QUIETER CHRISTIANITY IN SOUTH KOREA,,,A QUIETER CHRISTIANITY IN SOUTH KOREA,,,,By,[],,

Representatives of both sides spoke of the need to ease the ''pain and suffering'' of separated families, but longstanding differences over how to conduct the discussions were evident.   The chief South Korean delegate, Lee Yong Dok, suggested that the negotiators first deal only with ''humanitarian issues,'' leaving aside more overtly political matters such as attempts to reunify the divided peninsula. Mr. Lee said that later, ''our humanitarian project may well be a national undertaking linked directly to the unification of our homeland.''   But the chief North Korean delegate, Li Chong Yul, repeated a decades-old position that Korean reunification must receive top priority. ''The most important thing is that on humanitarian grounds we must work toward peace and unification,'' Mr. Li said.

As leading opposition politicians in the Philippines and South Korea, they were jailed, put under house arrest and sentenced to death by authoritarian East Asian governments that had American support. In May 1980, Aquino was released to come to the United States for medical treatment; Kim arrived two and a half years later for the same reason.

We remember the month as the one in which - June 25, 1950 was the date -the trouble began. Listen carefully, because you may find some of this hard to believe. So, apparently, did Gen. Omar Bradley, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time; he said the Korean business was ''the wrong war, at the wrong place, at the wrong time, and with the wrong enemy.'' Actually, the Korean War wasn't ever technically a war. Congress never declared it one. It was often called, for want of any better term, a ''police action.'' That gave little comfort then or since to the families of the 52,246 Americans who died in the course of whatever it was. For another strange thing, the conflict isn't technically over yet. Up at Panmunjom, near the 38th Parallel, which then and now divides North and South Korea, the details of a permanent settlement are still intermittently being thrashed out.

"  --------------------------------------------------------------------  Peter Hyun is a Korean-born editor and writer whose latest book is ''Introducing Korea.'' By PETER HYUN   The exhibition of ''5,000 Years of Korean Art'' - which opens at the Metropolitan Museum of Art next Saturday for a three-month run (en route to Kansas City and Washington, D.C., after its successful tours of San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, Cleveland and Boston) - may not top the recent ''King Tut'' or ''Pompeii'' shows in its mass appeal, but is certainly strong competition for them in both quality and scope.   This is not surprising. After all, Korea has since the birth of the nation 5,000 years ago produced a unique civilization of its own, including the world's first metal printing machine (some 200 years before the Gutenberg invention in Germany) and the hangul alphabet, regarded by Edwin O. Reischauer, the diplomat and Harvard Orientalist, as ''perhaps the most scientific system of writing in general use in any language.''   Unquestionably the most comprehensive Korean art collection to tour abroad, this exhibition is as extensive as the title indicates, ranging from a neolithic earthenware jar (circa 300 B.C.) to a pair of 20th-century landscape paintings. Between these chronological extremes is a breathtaking array of 345 objects: glittering gold crowns and jewels, gilt-bronze Buddhist images, world-renowned Koryo celadon, highly stylized genre paintings, exquisitely designed ceramic tiles.",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/04/arts/a-trove-of-unfamiliar-art-from-korea.html,,-------------------------------------------------------------------- Peter Hyun is a Korean-born editor and writer whose latest book is ''Introducing Korea.''

Behind the stream of propaganda about the mutual love between Mr. Kim and the people is a system of authority and discipline that has thrust itself into every corner of life. Basing itself on the claim of Mr. Kim's ''universal genius,'' the Government has set out to organize as many hours in the citizen's day as possible.   When officials are asked why so few people are in Pyongyang's streets, they say that it is because nearly everyone, from the smallest children to the elderly, is ''busy.''

As the flames engulf him, he shouts, ''Out with U.S. imperialists!'' and throws himself from a third-story ledge at Seoul National University.   The time-honored tradition of Korean student protest has emerged in a new, unpredictable and sometimes violent form. In recent weeks, three students have immolated themselves; clashes between riot policemen and student protesters have left two policemen dead and some students blinded, and small groups of students have tried to occupy the United States Embassy, a Korean-American bank and an American cultural center.   For most of modern South Korean history, to be a student has also meant to be a protester. Student demonstrations in 1960 brought down the Government of Syngman Rhee, and students have risked imprisonment and injury in subsequent protests against two military coups. The ranks of the Korean establishment - economists, businessmen, even Government officials - are filled with people who say they once were student protesters but who left activism behind when they left college.",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/17/world/korea-is-breeding-a-new-kind-of-college-radical.html,,"This is the haunting image of the new South Korean student activism: Lee Dong Soo, 22 years old, slowly and deliberately douses himself with gasoline and sets himself on fire.

"  The meeting was modern but the arrangements for it, in a way, go back a thousand years.   Lee Wook Soo and his wife, Lee Jung Ja, gathered quietly one recent evening with 14 other Korean couples at the Young Bin Kwan restaurant in midtown Manhattan. They ate and they drank and they carried forward a centuries-old custom of mutual trust that has made it possible for hundreds of Korean immigrants to open businesses in the city, businesses that have revitalized neighborhoods and increased the impact that this particular ethnic group has had on New York.   The custom is called a ''gyeh,'' a practice in which a group of people -like the couples in the restaurant -pool their money to form something much like a credit union. Each month someone else uses the collected money - usually interest free. This time it was the Lees' turn, and the $7,500 they took home was welcome.

The end is due in early April, and as far as the South Korean Government is concerned, it comes none too soon.    ''M*A*S*H,'' television's indefatigable antiwar satire, has been broadcast for years by the American Forces Korea Network as entertainment for the 40,000 United States service men and women stationed here.   But it means that week after week, Koreans, too, get to watch a program that many officials believe portrays their country unfairly as a somewhat backward, troublesome American dependent.

"MOOL Lae Bang Ah, or Water Wheel, is the second Korean restaurant to settle in the county, and very welcome it is. The restaurant features both Korean and Japanese cuisine; but in these visits we concentrated on the Korean dishes listed on the extensive menu. Newcomers to this cuisine shouldn't be shy. First of all, the menu, written in both Korean and English, provides diners with descriptions of every dish. And second, with its Mongolian-Chinese influence, Korean food is familiar. Bite-sized meats or fish mingle with finely sliced or shredded vegetables and rice. Ginger, soy sauce, scallions and garlic season most dishes. What makes the difference, however, are the fillips of searing chilies -- sometimes added directly to a dish, sometimes mixed into a paste that can be applied to taste -- and the side dishes of briny kimchee (pickled Chinese cabbage) that appear at every meal. The range of tastes is broad, from mild and soothing to incendiary. Be sure to state your preference every time, as the kitchen's hand isn't consistent in dealing out peppery heat.

 A particular attraction at Mool Lae Bang Ah are the grills, set flush into almost every table top and all ready for the ritual of Korean barbecue, a must.  The beef was excellent and made a much better choice than chicken, which, besides having little flavor, dried out on the grill. The waiter will start the grilling process, but once it has begun, try to take over, or at least remove the meat when done to your liking. We found the waiter's continued hovering over the grill intrusive, and we didn't share his taste for well-done beef, although even that remained juicy and full of meaty flavor.Classic, hearty soups are treated like main dishes here; find them hidden among the entree listings.  To be sure, Korean soups can be meals in themselves; simply add a bowl of rice. We enjoyed dumplings and rice cake slices in a full-flavored, soothing broth (duk mandoo guk).",https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/03/nyregion/dining-out-extensive-korean-menu-in-ardsley.html,"MOOL Lae Bang Ah, or Water Wheel, is the second Korean restaurant to settle in the county, and very welcome it is.

Although American officials have pieced together much of what happened to Flight 7 over East Asia, there are still these questions:     - Why did a South Korean jetliner with 269 people aboard enter Soviet airspace, apparently in disregard of well- known aviation warnings? Was it an accident or was it deliberate?     - Did air traffic controllers or intelligence people know that the jetliner was off course before its final communications with the control tower at Narita airport near Tokyo?     - What did air controllers do when they determined that the jetliner was missing?     - Did the pilot of the Soviet SU-15, who had visual contact with the jetliner, fail to identify the Boeing 747 as a commercial airliner before shooting it down?",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/08/world/korean-jetliner-what-is-known-and-what-isn-t.html,,"A week after a South Korean 747 airliner took off from Kennedy International Airport on a journey that was ended by a Soviet air-to-air missile, there are many unanswered questions.",A,1,The New York Times,[],"[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'South Korea', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'SAKHALIN ISLAND', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'organizations', 'value': 'Korean Air Lines', 'rank': 4, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'United States International Relations', 'rank': 5, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'International Relations', 'rank': 6, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES', 'rank': 7, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Military Bases and Installations', 'rank': 8, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Espionage', 'rank': 9, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'BOUNDARIES AND TERRITORIAL ISSUES', 'rank': 10, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Military Aircraft', 'rank': 11, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'AIRLINES', 'rank': 12, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'UNITED STATES ARMAMENT AND DEFENSE', 'rank': 13, 'major': 'N'}]",1983-09-08T05:00:00+0000,article,Foreign Desk,World,News,nyt://article/35985bbe-912d-5c5b-a2e5-5db34a0d85ae,3080,nyt://article/35985bbe-912d-5c5b-a2e5-5db34a0d85ae,KOREAN JETLINER: WHAT IS KNOWN AND WHAT ISN'T,,,KOREAN JETLINER: WHAT IS KNOWN AND WHAT ISN'T,,,,"By David Shribman, Special To the New York Times","[{'firstname': 'David', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': 'Shribman', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': None, 'middlename': None, 'lastname': None, 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}]",,
"  The South Korean airliner that the United States says was shot down by a Soviet fighter was equipped not only with three computerized navigation systems but with radar that enables pilots to follow coastlines and other terrain features.    Furthermore, the crew would normally have been able to verify the proper functioning of the navigation systems perhaps two hours after takeoff when their Boeing 747 jumbo jet flew past a powerful radio fix at the end of the Aleutian Island chain.   The availability of such electronic aids only magnified the puzzlement among safety experts as to why the South Korean crew deviated from course and strayed deep into Soviet territory.   Some experts asked whether there might have been a major malfunction that could have knocked out or distorted the readings of these electronic aids. If so, why then would the crew not have reported trouble when making radio reports to air-traffic-control facilities?",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/03/world/korean-airliner-carried-extra-navigation-aids.html,,The South Korean airliner that the United States says was shot down by a Soviet fighter was equipped not only with three computerized navigation systems but with radar that enables pilots to follow coastlines and other terrain features.,1,6,The New York Times,[],"[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'South Korea', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Sea of Japan', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'organizations', 'value': 'Korean Air Lines', 'rank': 4, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES', 'rank': 5, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'International Relations', 'rank': 6, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'BOUNDARIES AND TERRITORIAL ISSUES', 'rank': 7, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Navigation', 'rank': 8, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'AIRLINES', 'rank': 9, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'DATA PROCESSING', 'rank': 10, 'major': 'N'}]",1983-09-03T05:00:00+0000,article,Foreign Desk,World,News,nyt://article/3cb58411-da0c-576a-9b22-1cc059ce0689,849,nyt://article/3cb58411-da0c-576a-9b22-1cc059ce0689,KOREAN AIRLINER CARRIED EXTRA NAVIGATION AIDS,,,KOREAN AIRLINER CARRIED EXTRA NAVIGATION AIDS,,,,By Richard Witkin,"[{'firstname': 'Richard', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': 'Witkin', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}]",,

Along the way he crosses paths more than once with a nurse also heading north with her elderly charge and encounters a prostitute who dies soon after he sleeps with her.

"  Evidence introduced in lawsuits filed in connection with the Soviet downing of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 suggests that American radar operators knew hours beforehand that the jetliner was off course and heading into Soviet airspace.   The words, ''We should warn him,'' presumably referring to the plane's pilot, were heard at the Government's civil air-traffic control station in Alaska as the Boeing 747 strayed off course toward its fatal encounter with a Soviet fighter plane two years ago today, according to the documents.   The documents were submitted Friday as evidence in damage suits filed against the United States Government by relatives of the 269 people who died in the incident.

The Prime Minister, Yasuhiro Nakasone, offered no specific proposals in his remarks to President Chun Doo Hwan, and Japanese Government officials emphasized that his comments did not signal a Japanese shift away from basic support for South Korean diplomatic positions.   Japan has some economic ties but no formal relations with the North Korean Government in Pyongyang. Mr. Nakasone reportedly said there was ''no reason why this policy should change unless there is a major change in the international situation.''   Nevertheless, any reference to possible fresh initiatives to North Korea - no matter how thickly veiled - is enough to raise concern among South Korean officials.

Mr. Chun's hold on power appears to be secure, but he is responding warily to requests by the Christian dissidents for small, new prerogatives.   Recently, at talks with church leaders, he agreed to allow prayer meetings to be resumed at the headquarters of the Korean National Council of Churches, once a center of resistance to Mr. Park.

Most of the world outside the Soviet Union has heard by now of the Korean Flight 7, carrying 269 persons between New York and Seoul, which strayed off course into Soviet airspace, was tracked by Soviet radar, was targeted by a Soviet SU-15 whose pilot cooly and after careful consideration fired two air-launched missiles which destroyed the Korean airliner and apparently its 269 passengers and crew.   This calculated attack on a civilian airliner - unarmed, undefended, as civilian airliners always are - has shocked the world.   Only the Soviet people have still not heard about this attack on the K.A.L. 7 and the death of the passengers, because the Soviet Government has not acknowledged firing on the Korean airliner.

The book, ''The Target Is Destroyed,'' says intercepted communications gathered by these listening devices were not available to intelligence officials until hours and days after the attack on Sept. 1, 1983, too late to save the lives of the 269 people aboard the airliner. The plane had strayed hundreds of miles off course and into Soviet airspace, where it flew over sensitive military installations.   The book, by Seymour M. Hersh, is based on two years of research and includes interviews in the United States, the Soviet Union and Japan.

"   Documents released today give details on a decision by President Dwight D. Eisenhower's Administration in 1953 to use atomic bombs in North Korea and Communist China, if necessary, to end the Korean War.   Once the armistice was achieved, on July 27, 1953, the Eisenhower Administration continued to define plans to use nuclear weapons if the Communists renewed the war, which the North Koreans started in 1950.   President Eisenhower took office in January 1953 after talks for a cease-fire had dragged on for two years and the war had settled into a standoff, with casualties being incurred but with no change in the front line, which today still separates North and South Korea.   The fact that the Eisenhower Administration was ready to use nuclear weapons is not new. President Eisenhower, in his memoirs, said he came into office prepared to use them, if necessary, to break the deadlock. What is new in the 2,000 pages of documents now made public is the high level of planning and the detail of discussion on possible use of these weapons, and Mr. Eisenhower's interest in overcoming reluctance to use them.",https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/08/world/us-papers-tell-of-53-policy-to-use-a-bomb-in-korea.html,,"Documents released today give details on a decision by President Dwight D.

Today was the first time Mr. O had left his mission at 40 East 80th Street since last September.   For the State Department, whose officials have been negotiating here since Thursday with North Korean aides, Mr. O's surrender was viewed as tacit confirmation of their doctrine of partial or functional immunity.

"  The South Korean airliner shot down by the Soviet Air Force in 1983 was not on an espionage mission, but the Russians, in a series of blunders, believed they were attacking an American reconnaissance flight, according to a magazine article.   The article, which will be published next month in The Atlantic Monthly, is based on a review of American intelligence data and on interviews with Soviet officials. It concludes that the plane penetrated Soviet airspace because of navigational errors by the Korean Air Lines crew and not, as the Soviet Union contended, because it was on an espionage mission.   The evidence gathered by American intelligence, which has not been made public, also contradicts the United States' initial contention that the Soviet Union had knowingly shot down the airliner, killing the 269 people aboard.

"  The Pentagon may have withheld for three decades evidence suggesting that 389 American soldiers classified as missing in action in the Korean War were actually prisoners left behind when the shooting stopped, according to documents in a Federal trial that is to begin Tuesday.   The trial in Federal District Court here will probably touch on the sensitive relationship in 1953 between demands for the release of American prisoners of war and negotiations to end the war.   Robert Dumas, who has been searching since then for his brother, Roger, an Army private listed as missing in action and later as presumed dead, says he feels the Government may have accepted an end to the war at the expense of a few hundred of its servicemen.   Mr. Dumas's suit, filed against Army Secretary John O.

"  Korean Air Lines, whose off-course 747 carrying 269 people was shot down by the Soviet Union, has a mixed reputation among aviation officials, industry executives and pilots.   But all seem to agree that the Korean flag carrier is ''extremely aggressive'' in its quest for rapid growth, its bargain-basement pricing of tickets and its willingness to assume huge debts to finance its ambitious plans.   According to some airline officials and pilots, the corporate inclination toward aggressiveness is seen in the flying practices of Korean Air Lines pilots, nearly all of whom are alumni of the South Korean Air Force.   For example, there is a practice some pilots use to land their plane before others.

After peering at the wall through a telescope from his observation post in the hilly terrain east of Panmunjom, the truce village in the demilitarized zone, Maj. Kang Myong Su of the North Korean Army stepped back and said: ''This is our tragedy. Nobody has the right to build a barrier across our country, to try and divide our people forever.''   In Major Kang's briefing, the villain is the United States. The wall he inspects - more than 15 feet high and 30 feet wide at its base, with concrete sides and filled with earth - was completed in 1979. In conception, it is at least partly an American wall, running 150 miles along the entire length of the demilitarized zone. A Ruse or a Barricade?  From the viewpoint of the United States and its allies in South Korea, the wall's purpose is to block a North Korean invasion. To Major Kang and his superiors in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, all talk of an attack by the North is an American ruse to justify the division of Korea and insure a permanent United States military presence.",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/11/world/north-korea-tries-hard-to-portray-itself-as-peaceful-and-us-as-the-villain.html,,Few sights that officials show visitors to this Communist nation are invested with greater symbolic importance than a huge wall that snakes across the Korean Peninsula from the Yellow Sea to the Sea of Japan.,A,10,The New York Times,[],"[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'South Korea', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'North Korea', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'United States International Relations', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Military Bases and Installations', 'rank': 4, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'International Relations', 'rank': 5, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES', 'rank': 6, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Surveys and Series', 'rank': 7, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'BOUNDARIES AND TERRITORIAL ISSUES', 'rank': 8, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'UNITED STATES ARMAMENT AND DEFENSE', 'rank': 9, 'major': 'N'}]",1985-07-11T05:00:00+0000,article,Foreign Desk,World,Series,nyt://article/8cb4a38c-a415-5c4f-ae9a-d1565e567209,2023,nyt://article/8cb4a38c-a415-5c4f-ae9a-d1565e567209,NORTH KOREA TRIES HARD TO PORTRAY ITSELF AS PEACEFUL AND U.S. AS THE VILLAIN,,,NORTH KOREA TRIES HARD TO PORTRAY ITSELF AS PEACEFUL AND U.S. AS THE VILLAIN,,,,"By John F.

Deaver represented a foreign client at a meeting with an official of the National Security Council five months after he left his job as deputy White House chief of staff, according to a report he filed with the Justice Department.   A Government ethics official said the meeting was within the law, but Congressional critics of Mr. Deaver strongly disagreed.   David Martin, director of the Office of Government Ethics, sent a letter to the Justice Department today asking it to investigate whether Mr. Deaver had violated conflict-of-interest laws. Mr. Martin declined to produce the letter or explain what had prompted it. On Thursday five Democratic Senators sent a letter similar to Mr. Martin's to Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d, setting in motion a procedure that can lead to the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate Mr. Deaver's activities.   Under the law, the Attorney General must respond within 30 days and tell the senators whether he has asked a three-judge Federal court to appoint an independent counsel, or, if not, why not.",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/26/us/deaver-lobbied-for-the-koreans-5-months-after-leaving-us-post.html,,"Michael K.

"  In Kyoon Ahn, a Korean greengrocer, is not likely to join Ernesto Miranda or Clarence Gideon on the title page of a landmark legal decision.   But the relatively meager record in a case involving Mr. Ahn illustrates many facets of contemporary New York: the ethnic and racial tensions in its changing neighborhoods, the attempts of its law-enforcement machinery to deal with them, and the way its criminal-justice system lurches to a result, sometimes in spite of itself.   Recently, Judge Ira B. Harkavy of Brooklyn Criminal Court dismissed assault and harassment charges against Mr. Ahn and one of his employees. The charges stemmed from an incident last February at Mr. Ahn's Brooklyn store, a squabble with a customer that suddenly thrust him into a wholly alien role: defendant in a criminal prosecution.   Mr. Ahn and his employee, Tae Ho Jung, were arrested after they tried to restrain a woman they said was stealing produce from their store, at 1052 Flatbush Avenue, in the Flatbush section.

The pilot, who appeared to be about 45 years old, with graying, tousled hair, a rugged face and a raspy voice, was not named or identified by rank.   ''I had a specific task assigned me,'' he said, ''and I tried to accomplish it as well as possible - a military task, which is the meaning of my entire life.''   He sat slouched in an easy chair, dressed in a brown leather jacket, blue cotton pants and blue shirt as he spoke to the interviewer, Aleksandr Tikhomirov of Soviet state television, on a base on Sakhalin island.   The pilot described his certainty that he was dealing with an ''enemy aircraft,'' and told how he had wagged the wings of his SU-15 and fired four bursts of tracer shells along the jetliner's route.  ''This in international code signifies that 'you're an intruder,' '' he said. ''He had to answer somehow that 'yes, I'm an intruding aircraft and in trouble,' and I would've helped him if he was in trouble, and if he was an intruder he could have landed on our airfield and we would have sorted it out.''",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/11/world/pilot-who-shot-down-korean-jet-is-interviewed-on-soviet-television.html,,Soviet television broadcast an interview tonight with a Soviet fighter pilot who was identified as having shot down the Korean Air Lines 747 jetliner last week.,1,1,The New York Times,[],"[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'South Korea', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'organizations', 'value': 'Korean Air Lines', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'PASSENGER SERVICES', 'rank': 4, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES', 'rank': 5, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Military Aircraft', 'rank': 6, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'AIRLINES', 'rank': 7, 'major': 'N'}]",1983-09-11T05:00:00+0000,article,Foreign Desk,World,News,nyt://article/cf84cc67-23ab-5f71-9e06-e5198fd8ac59,1285,nyt://article/cf84cc67-23ab-5f71-9e06-e5198fd8ac59,PILOT WHO SHOT DOWN KOREAN JET IS INTERVIEWED ON SOVIET TELEVISION,,,PILOT WHO SHOT DOWN KOREAN JET IS INTERVIEWED ON SOVIET TELEVISION,,,,By Sergd Schmemann,"[{'firstname': 'Sergd', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': 'Schmemann', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}]",,

"  Transcript of Shultz remarks, page 4.          WASHINGTON, Sept. 2 - Secretary of State George P. Shultz accused the Soviet Union today of continuing to ''cover up the facts'' of the apparent shooting down of a South Korean airliner.   Rejecting the latest Soviet statement on the loss of the Korean Air Lines 747, in which 269 people died, Mr. Shultz said, ''The world is waiting for the Soviet Union to tell the truth.''   In Moscow, the official press agency, Tass, distributed a statement asserting that the Korean Air Lines plane was carrying out a ''preplanned act'' for ''special intelligence aims'' in crossing into Soviet airspace. Tass also said a Soviet plane had fired tracer shells to warn the plane, but did not admit it had shot the plane down.",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/03/world/soviet-says-interceptor-fired-warning-shots-korean-jet-shultz-denounces-cover-up.html,,"Transcript of Shultz remarks, page 4.",1,1,The New York Times,[],"[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'UNITED STATES (1983 PART 1)', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'South Korea', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Sea of Japan', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS', 'rank': 4, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'SAKHALIN ISLAND (USSR)', 'rank': 5, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'organizations', 'value': 'Korean Air Lines', 'rank': 6, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Reagan, Ronald Wilson', 'rank': 7, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'SHULTZ, GEORGE PRATT', 'rank': 8, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'PASSENGER SERVICES', 'rank': 9, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'United States International Relations', 'rank': 10, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'International Relations', 'rank': 11, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES', 'rank': 12, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Military Aircraft', 'rank': 13, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'NATIONAL SECURITY', 'rank': 14, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISSILES', 'rank': 15, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'AIRLINES', 'rank': 16, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'EMBARGOES', 'rank': 17, 'major': 'N'}]",1983-09-03T05:00:00+0000,article,Foreign Desk,World,News,nyt://article/50671d32-d0db-5878-a68f-207b38d88baf,1585,nyt://article/50671d32-d0db-5878-a68f-207b38d88baf,SHULTZ DENOUNCES 'COVER-UP',SOVIET SAYS INTERCEPTOR FIRED WARNING SHOTS AT KOREAN JET,,SOVIET SAYS INTERCEPTOR FIRED WARNING SHOTS AT KOREAN JET; SHULTZ DENOUNCES 'COVER-UP',,,,By Bernard Gwertzman,"[{'firstname': 'Bernard', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': 'Gwertzman', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}]",,

"  To the Editor:   The July 20 letter of Maj. Gen. D. K. Yoon, the Korean security attache, claiming that the American-headed United Nations command in Korea has never ''commanded any element of Korean forces,'' but only exerted operational control, confirms the need for our disengagement from an alarmingly ambivalent command situation, which could fly apart (as it almost did on entry into North Korea in early October 1950) if serious military stress were placed on it.   Establishment of the U.N. command responded to a July 7, 1950, Security Council vote requesting that all armed forces resisting the northern aggression, including South Korea's, be placed ''under a unified command headed by the United States.'' The command was comprehensive militarily and rapidly spread to civilian relief. On July 14, 1950, President Syngman Rhee ''placed the security forces of the Republic under General MacArthur, the U.N. commander.'' ''General Walker directed the R.O.K. army through its own chief of staff'' (page 112, U.S. Army Office of Military History account of the Korean War). Comprehensive ''command authority'' was awarded the U.N. commander.

"  To the Editor:      Donald Ranard's Oct. 14 Op-Ed article, ''Korea's Edgy D.M.Z. Extends to America,'' is fundamentally wrongheaded in its attempt to damn both South Korea and North Korea equally for the continuance of tensions on the Korean peninsula. It is simply out of tune with history.   The principal cause for the continued tension is North Korea's repeated violations of the Korean Armistice Agreement. By the latest count, North Korea has accused the U.N. (which administers the agreement) of almost 328,000 violations, of which the U.N. has admitted 107. The U.N., on its part, has accused North Korea of almost 76,000 violations, of which the North admitted two.",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/14/opinion/l-tensions-that-serve-the-national-interest-of-north-korea-036672.html,,To the Editor:,A,18,The New York Times,[],"[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'TERMS NOT AVAILABLE', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1983-11-14T05:00:00+0000,article,Editorial Desk,Opinion,Letter,nyt://article/4eda3f0a-3715-582e-8deb-5f2cebfd6f2e,487,nyt://article/4eda3f0a-3715-582e-8deb-5f2cebfd6f2e,TENSIONS THAT SERVE THE 'NATIONAL INTEREST' OF NORTH KOREA,,,TENSIONS THAT SERVE THE 'NATIONAL INTEREST' OF NORTH KOREA,,,,,[],,

"  To the Editor:   In his letter (''In Korea, Democracy Is Still an Illusion,'' May 11), Sung-il Choi makes several errors in fact that need correction.   He states that under the present system of presidential elections in Korea, ''an electoral college, the National Council of Unification, elects the president.'' He then goes on to say that ''the system guarantees the triumph of a Government-favored candidate'' because the delegates to the electoral college ''are elected from a slate of candidates screened by the Government and are not bound to vote in selecting the president according to the preference of the citizens.''   What Mr. Choi describes as ''the present system'' is actually the former system under the so-called Yushin Constitution of Korea, which was replaced when the Constitution of the Fifth Republic was adopted in 1980. By way of explanation, the Yushin Constitution was written by President Park Chung Hee in 1972. Among other things, its language insured the incumbency of the then-president.",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/25/opinion/l-korea-has-reformed-its-electoral-system-003835.html,,To the Editor:,1,22,The New York Times,[],"[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'TERMS NOT AVAILABLE', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1985-05-25T05:00:00+0000,article,Editorial Desk,Opinion,Letter,nyt://article/a938edf6-1140-5d98-97be-ae50b33e1c39,696,nyt://article/a938edf6-1140-5d98-97be-ae50b33e1c39,Korea Has Reformed Its Electoral System,,,Korea Has Reformed Its Electoral System,,,,,[],,

"  To the Editor:    We are pleased by reports that the South Korean Government does not plan to reimprison the opposition leader Kim Dae Jung when he returns home from two years of exile in the United States (''South Korea Says Dissident Won't Be Seized on Return,'' news article, Feb. 4).   Mr. Kim's patriotism, courage and commitment to democracy and fundamental human rights are a matter of record. It is characteristic of him that he responded to the South Korean Government's earlier threat of imprisonment by reaffirming his intention to return according to his announced schedule, on Feb. 8. One of his declared aims in returning at this time is to help make sure that the opposition remains moderate and nonviolent and to prevent the development of extreme political polarization.",https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/06/opinion/l-how-south-korea-can-show-good-faith-006539.html,,To the Editor:,A,22,The New York Times,[],"[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'TERMS NOT AVAILABLE', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1985-02-06T05:00:00+0000,article,Editorial Desk,Opinion,Letter,nyt://article/c5cc5308-913b-5423-b71f-1d4dcfd8c50e,377,nyt://article/c5cc5308-913b-5423-b71f-1d4dcfd8c50e,How South Korea Can Show Good Faith,,,How South Korea Can Show Good Faith,,,,,[],,

"  To the Editor:   William Tucker asks: ""What's the quickest way we can get our children away from these ethnically divisive zealots who have captured the public school system?"" (""You Call This Giving Thanks? No Thanks,"" letter, Nov. 22). I suggest he send his son to a private, preferably religious school.   At my daughter's Roman Catholic school, all first, second and third graders came to school on the eve of Thanksgiving dressed as Indians or Pilgrims. The newly arrived pilgrims included three Koreans; the ranks of Indians were swollen with African-American, Columbian, Cuban and Egyptian children.   Each year on United Nations Day, Oct. 24, the children wear their native costumes, eat an international lunch cooked by school mothers, hear speeches and see films on the world's children and their needs, and respond actively to these needs through discussions, essay writing, poster making and collection of food and money for the United Nations Children's Fund and for those in need locally.   The only visible unity between church and state at this institution is that the children pray regularly for their political leaders, for peace in the world, for a healthier environment and for teachers and administrators in the local school system and borough government.    Perhaps next Thanksgiving, politicians and parents ought to give thanks to religious schools for promoting the values for which our forebears most struggled: liberty, justice and equality.

"  To the Editor:   Edward W. Poitras's well-pitched call for ''serious adjustments in United States policy toward South Korea'' (Op-Ed, April 30) is more important than most realize.   A cogent case in point is the anachronistic ''U.N. command,'' exercised for 35 years by a four-star U.S. general. It incorporates ''command authority over all land, sea and air forces of the Republic of Korea'' given to it on July 14, 1950, by President Syngman Rhee under extreme duress from the North Korean inva-sion, to last ''during the period of continuation of the present state of hostilities.''

Mr. Bush, who came from Japan after a two-day visit, is on a tour of Asia that is scheduled to last two weeks.  Mr. Bush's three-day tour is part of celebrations marking a hundred years of American contacts with Korea. It is also designed to reaffirm traditional American military and diplomatic support for the Seoul Government. Mr. Bush is to visit a United States Army unit close to the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea - there are about 40,000 American soldiers in the south - and to confer with President Chun Doo Hwan on military and political issues.   Preparations for the visit were low key, with few of the giant welcome signs that are the usual greeting for Americans of high rank.  There are signs of concern among Korean officials about how the United States will respond to signs of anti-Americanism here. One of these signs was arson at the American Cultural Center in Pusan last month that was led by theology students. The incident was widely interpreted by churchmen, including conservatives, as an emotional outburst against American support for Mr. Chun.",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/25/world/bush-visiting-seoul-amid-worry-over-anti-us-acts.html,,"Vice President Bush, the highest official of the Reagan Administration to visit South Korea, arrived here this morning amid increasing expressions of concern in Korea about growing anti-American sentiment.",1,3,The New York Times,[],"[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'South Korea', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'UNITED STATE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'TRAVEL, PERSONAL', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",1982-04-25T05:00:00+0000,article,Foreign Desk,World,News,nyt://article/5a3ab5c3-53e6-5b31-8b53-acd896ca5d20,786,nyt://article/5a3ab5c3-53e6-5b31-8b53-acd896ca5d20,BUSH VISITING SEOUL AMID WORRY OVER ANTI-U.S. ACTS,,,BUSH VISITING SEOUL AMID WORRY OVER ANTI-U.S. ACTS,,,,"By Henry Scott Stokes, Special To the New York Times","[{'firstname': 'Henry', 'middlename': 'Scott', 'lastname': 'Stokes', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': None, 'middlename': None, 'lastname': None, 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}]",,
