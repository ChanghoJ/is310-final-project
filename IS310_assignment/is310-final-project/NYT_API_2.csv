This is a small country, and it is still unspoiled by tourists. The verdant countryside is one giant rice paddy that offers a sharp contrast to the drabness of the capital city of Seoul. Seoul, however, is only architecturally drab. The friendliness of the people, the colorful local costumes worn by both men and women, the unusual food and the gracious royal palaces more than compensate for the outward unattractiveness of this city of more than 3 million. Korea, once called Chosen, has been occupied for many centuries—first by the Chinese, then by the Japanese, later by the Russians and then once again by the Japanese. The continuous occupation by a series of unwelcome invaders caused this small nation to withdraw from the world. Visitors were refused entry, and Korean nationals could not leave their country; in fact, so great was the withdrawal that this became known as the Hermit.
