It's the kind of didactic work that only Jean-Luc Godard has ever successfully transformed into film, not because Mr. Godard is such a brilliant political philosopher, which he isn't, but because his brilliance as a film maker is irrepressible.On the basis of these two films, Mr. Oshima is certainly talented as well as hugely concerned and committed to the sort of cinema that plays an active role in its society. As long as ""Death by Hanging"" sticks to capital punishment, it is, in its absurd way, provocative and entertaining. But the film's interests keep widening, its methods become increasingly, arbitrarily Godardian (read Brechtian), until it reaches a point of total confusion.In order to be able to execute the murderer again, the prison team decides it must convince the man who he is (his name is simply R). They act out charades designed to make R remember. Involved are his identity as a murderer, as well as his identity as a Korean, a people long oppressed by the Japanese. Kafka, Freud and some other weighty presences are evoked by Mr. Oshima as straight editorializing, through Godardian monologues. One of R's problems is that he loved his sister, which doesn't seem to have a great deal to do with legalized murder and capital punishment.Some of it is funny. More of it is tedious, and a lot of it curiously old-fashioned, even though it reminds us of the great Godard films of the mid-nineteen-sixties.

As long as ""Death by Hanging"" sticks to capital punishment, it is, in its absurd way, provocative and entertaining. But the film's interests keep widening, its methods become increasingly, arbitrarily Godardian (read Brechtian), until it reaches a point of total confusion.In order to be able to execute the murderer again, the prison team decides it must convince the man who he is (his name is simply R). They act out charades designed to make R remember. Involved are his identity as a murderer, as well as his identity as a Korean, a people long oppressed by the Japanese. Kafka, Freud and some other weighty presences are evoked by Mr. Oshima as straight editorializing, through Godardian monologues. One of R's problems is that he loved his sister, which doesn't seem to have a great deal to do with legalized murder and capital punishment.Some of it is funny. More of it is tedious, and a lot of it curiously old-fashioned, even though it reminds us of the great Godard films of the mid-nineteen-sixties. Extreme movie styles date more quickly than hemlines.",,The New York Times,[],"[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MOTION PICTURES', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'creative_works', 'value': 'Death by Hanging (Koshikel) (Movie)', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1974-02-15T05:00:00+0000,article,,Archives,Review,nyt://article/9351421b-da0d-5813-b42a-97bf1c6091ea,719,nyt://article/9351421b-da0d-5813-b42a-97bf1c6091ea,Screen: Japanese 'Death by Hanging':Young Korean Rapist Survives Execution Oshima Work Brings Memory of Godard,,,Screen: Japanese 'Death by Hanging':Young Korean Rapist Survives Execution Oshima Work Brings Memory of Godard,,,,By Vincent Canby,"[{'firstname': 'Vincent', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': 'Canby', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}]",,
