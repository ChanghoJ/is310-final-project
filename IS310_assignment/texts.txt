-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	FADE IN:
	
	EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE establishing the race track, Ruidoso Downs
	(pronounced Ree-oh-do-so), set among the beautiful mountains
	of New Mexico's Lincoln National Forest, as a white Chrysler
	turns in with a stream of cars moving toward the parking
	area.
	
	AN ANGLE through the open driver-side window of the Chrysler
	at LILLY DILLON, 39 but looking younger, beautiful but cold
	and watchful.
	
	WIDE SHOT, track in b.g. as Lilly parks the Chrysler, gets
	out, locks the car. As she walks toward the track, WIPE
	RIGHT, as SCENE TWO WIPES IN from the left. SCENE ONE CAMERA
	FOLLOWS Lilly as she walks across the large parking area.
	SPLIT SCREEN.
	
	SCENE TWO:
	
	EXT. SIDE STREET - DAY
	
	Downtown Los Angeles, near the courts and the business
	section. ROY DILLON, 25, handsome and charming but self
	indulgent, parks his orange Honda convertible, gets out,
	picks up a large ledger book from the back seat, goes around
	to open the trunk.
	
	AN ANGLE on the trunk, establishing the tools of the
	salesman's trade: catalogs, samples, ledgers full of manuals
	and product sheets. Roy adds the ledger from the back seat,
	shuts the trunk, walks away.
	
	EXT. 6TH STREET - DAY
	
	Roy walks around the corner near a bar/restaurant. As he
	approaches it, WIPE LEFT, the two half-width scenes
	contracting to one-third each as SCENE THREE WIPES IN from
	the right.
	
	SCENE ONE: Lilly approaches the track's entrance doors.
	
	SCENE TWO: Roy approaches the bar.
	
	SCENE THREE:
	
	EXT. SANTA MONICA BOULEVARD - DAY
	
	A baby blue Cadillac parks in front of a jeweler.
	
	AN ANGLE on the driver's door as MYRA LANGTRY, 36, beautiful
	in an impersonal calculating way, gets out, carrying a small
	jewelry care, and locks the car. At first glance, Myra looks
	rather like Lilly. (Myra always wears large dangly earrings,
	and usually wears big-lensed dark sunglasses.)
	
	SIMULTANEOUSLY:
	
	SCENE ONE: Lilly enters the track.
	
	SCENE TWO: Roy enters the bar.
	
	SCENE THREE: Myra enters the jeweler's.
	
	WIPE RIGHT AND LEFT, as SCENE TWO takes FULL SCREEN.
	
	INT. BAR - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE on a hurried bartender in a full bar, crowded with a
	NOISY lunchtime crowd. In b.g., Roy slithers his way to the
	bar, waving a bill in the air to attract the bartender's
	attention.
	
	AN ANGLE on Roy as the bartender comes to him. Roy puts the
	bill on the bar, holding it down with one finger, as he
	SHOUTS his order. The bartender looks down.
	
	BARTENDER'S POV: Roy's finger holds down a twenty dollar
	bill.
	
	AN ANGLE steep over Roy's shoulder, the twenty visible, as
	the bartender hurries away to get the drink. Roy's hand makes
	a fist, swallowing the twenty, opens, pushing a ten out onto
	the bar, holding it there with one finger.
	
	AN ANGLE on the bartender returning with a draft beer,
	nodding to other ORDERS shouted to him along the way, putting
	the beer down, grabbing the bill without looking at it,
	hurrying away.
	
	AN ANGLE on Roy, content, smiling, sipping his beer.
	
	AN ANGLE on the bartender, hurrying by, slapping Roy's change
	down, moving on, Roy nodding acknowledgement, reaching out.
	
	CU, the change, a ten dollar bill on top. Roy's hand closes
	over it.
	
	EXT. TOTE BOARD - DAY
	
	WIDE SHOT, the tote board at the track, showing the shifting
	odds on the horses for the next race, the amounts bet.
	
	CLOSE SHOT, number 3. Not much bet, odds 70-1.
	
	EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE on Lilly, frowning at the tote board. She carries a
	large heavy shoulder-bag, which she opens, looking in it as
	though it were a file drawer.
	
	AN ANGLE on Lilly studying the contents of her bag, the track
	beyond her, the mountains visible out beyond the track wall.
	Lilly moves.
	
	AN ANGLE on a high-dollar betting window, as Lilly
	approaches, taking bank-banded wads of bills from her bag.
	
	EXT. TOTE BOARD - DAY
	
	A change of numbers sweeps across the board.
	
	EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
	
	Lilly moves away from the betting window, tucking betting
	tickets into her bag.
	
	ECU, Lilly's bag, compartmented, with stacks of money, small
	envelopes and notes on notepaper in each compartment. Lilly
	carefully files the betting slips.
	
	AN ANGLE on Lilly looking out at the tote board.
	
	EXT. TOTE BOARD - DAY
	
	CU, number 3. Odds 32-1.
	
	EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE on Lilly, not satisfied. She turns and goes back.
	
	AN ANGLE at the betting window as Lilly arrives and makes
	more bets.
	
	EXT. TOTE BOARD - DAY
	
	CU, number 3. Odds 32-1. CROWD NOISE INCREASES. The numbers
	shift: odds 26-1.
	
	                    CALLER (O.S.)
	          And they're off!
	
	INT. JEWELER'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	Very quiet, stately; abrupt contrast with the track. A slow
	ticking clock.
	Myra sits in the client's chair, while at the desk sits the
	JEWELER, a pleasant but overweight man of 40, who studies a
	jeweled bracelet through a loupe. He sighs, drops the loupe,
	shakes his head regretfully.
	
	                    JEWELER
	          Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Why? What's wrong?
	
	                    JEWELER
	              (personal emotion mixed
	               in)
	          You are a valued customer, as you
	          know.
	
	                    MYRA
	          But what's wrong?
	
	                    JEWELER
	          I can't understand a thing like
	          this. It's something you almost
	          never see.
	
	                    MYRA
	          What is?
	
	                    JEWELER
	              (holding up bracelet)
	          This is some of the finest
	          filigreed platinum I've ever seen.
	          But the stones, no. They're not
	          diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
	
	                    MYRA
	          But they must be! They cut glass!
	
	                    JEWELER
	              (wry)
	          Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry.
	          Do you know where it was purchased?
	
	INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
	
	An expensive hotel room, with a sunstruck day beyond the
	windows. Myra, naked, a few years younger, sits cross-legged
	on the bed and laughs at COLE "FARMER" LANGLEY, 55, stringy
	bodied, who stands naked, his back to us, hands on hips,
	presenting himself to Myra. She reaches forward, hand hidden
	by his body as she lifts something that was hanging on
	something at the front of him. She brings back the bracelet,
	looks at it, is delighted, puts it on, and then leans forward
	again toward the unmoving Cole, her head hidden by his body.
	
	INT. JEWELER'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	                    MYRA
	          It was a gift. It isn't worth
	          anything at all?
	
	                    JEWELER
	              (warm, encouraging)
	          Why, of course it is. I can offer
	          you -- well, five hundred dollars.
	
	Myra expected -- and needed -- a lot more. She's worried,
	tense, but stuck. She nods.
	
	                    MYRA
	          All right.
	
	                    JEWELER
	              (rising)
	          I'll get you a check.
	
	He leaves the room. Myra grimaces, in almost physical pain.
	
	INT. SECOND BAR - DAY
	
	Another crowded lunchtime bar. A big beefy BARTENDER moves
	quickly, carrying a draft beer.
	
	AN ANGLE on Roy, in position, finger holding bill down, as
	the bartender arrives, puts down the beer, reaches for the
	bill, stops, stares at the bill.
	
	TWO SHOT, the bartender and Roy, as the bartender gives Roy a
	very cold look. He knows, and Roy knows he knows. Roy tries
	an innocent smile, which doesn't work. Roy moves.
	
	CU, the ten dollar bill, as Roy grabs it, but the bartender
	simultaneously grabs Roy's wrist.
	
	AN ANGLE on Roy and the bartender as Roy tries to pull away
	and the bartender holds him with his left hand while reaching
	under the bar with his right. He comes up with a sawed-off
	baseball bat. Roy, seeing it, throws his free arm up to
	protect his head, but the bartender pushes the blunt end of
	the bat straight across the bar at a downward angle and hard
	into Roy's solar plexus, driving the air out of him and
	propelling him back away from the bar, leaving the ten. The
	nearest CUSTOMERS on both sides become aware that something
	happened, but nothing follows and they're already involved in
	conversations. The bartender scoops up the ten as he puts the
	bat away under the bar.
	
	AN ANGLE on Roy, arms folded across his torso, staring in
	shock toward the bar, where the space he filled has already
	been closed in by other bodies. Nearly retching, he stumbles
	toward the door.
	
	EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE on four PEOPLE at a table, CHEERING a race,
	switching to disgust and despair when they lose, moving away
	from the table, leaving their betting tickets behind. Lilly
	passes by, smoothly and casually scoops up the tickets, moves
	on along a row of tables, and there finding more tickets.
	
	INT. JEWELER'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	Myra sits as before. The jeweler enters with a check, which
	he hands her. She looks up at him, making no move to leave.
	
	                    JEWELER
	          I hope you're not too badly
	          disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
	
	                    MYRA
	          It's not your fault.
	
	                    JEWELER
	          You'll give us an opportunity to
	          serve you again, I hope. If there's
	          anything you think we might be
	          interested in...
	
	                    MYRA
	          I have only one thing now. Are you
	          interested?
	
	                    JEWELER
	          Well, I'd have to see it, of
	          course.
	
	                    MYRA
	          You are seeing it. You're looking
	          right at it.
	
	The jeweler is puzzled, then startled.
	
	                    JEWELER
	          I see.
	
	He turns away, goes behind his desk, sits down, looks at
	Myra.
	
	                    JEWELER
	          You know something, Mrs. Langtry? A
	          bracelet like that very rarely
	          happens. A fine setting and
	          workmanship usually mean precious
	          stones. It always hurts me when I
	          find they're not. I always hope -- 
	              (faint sad friendly smile)
	          -- I'm mistaken.
	
	Myra likes him better now, even though he hasn't solved her
	problem. She rises.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Thank you. For everything you felt
	          you could do.
	
	EXT. STREET - DAY
	
	Roy has been throwing up but is finished now. He's sprawled
	like a shot deer across the hood of his Honda, still
	clutching his stomach. A police car stops, the passenger COP
	gets out. He's suspicious at first.
	
	                    COP
	          Sir? Everything all right?
	
	The sight of the uniform forces Roy into gear. He
	straightens, smiling through his pain.
	
	                    ROY
	          Getting better. A bad shrimp, I
	          think.
	
	The con's suspicion changes to concern.
	
	                    COP
	          Want us to take you to a doctor?
	
	                    ROY
	          No no, I'm fine now, thanks,
	          anyway. Still got a lot of clients
	          to see.
	
	                    COP
	          Take it easy, now.
	
	                    ROY
	          Oh, I will.
	
	EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
	
	Late afternoon. AN ANGLE on the parking area, where almost
	all the cars are gone and the few remaining are widely
	separated. The white Chrysler is one of these. Lilly walks to
	it from the track entrance.
	
	AN ANGLE on the Chrysler as Lilly opens the trunk, puts her
	bag inside.
	
	CLOSE UP, Lilly and the trunk. She takes betting tickets from
	her bag, sorts them, files them in envelopes in different
	compartments, puts some to one side, then sorts through these
	separated tickets, throwing some away, keeping some. She
	takes money from the bag, puts tickets in, closes the bag
	with the money on the trunk floor. Reaching farther in, she
	lifts the pad deep inside the trunk, lifts the metal floor
	panel, and reveals a cache mostly filled with money. She adds
	today's skim, puts everything away, puts the bag back on her
	shoulder, closes the trunk.
	
	EXT. MADERO APARTMENTS - DAY
	
	A shabby apartment hotel on Wilshire. An exterior hall
	balcony on each floor has the entrance doors to the front
	apartments. Roy's Honda makes the turn and enters the
	basement garage.
	
	INT. MADERO LOBBY - DAY
	
	Modest but clean. The owner, SIMMS, a sloppy garrulous old
	bore, talks with a potential RENTER.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          Put it this way, now. Say I rent to
	          a woman, well, she has to have a
	          room with a bath. I insist on it,
	          because otherwise she's got the
	          hall bath tied up all the time,
	          washing her goddamn hair and her
	          clothes and everything she can
	          think of.
	
	In b.g., Roy, still in pain, comes out of the elevator, waves
	to Simms, who waves back without pausing in his monologue,
	and crosses to the mailboxes.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          Now, your minimum for a room with
	          bath is three hundred a month, just
	          for a place to sleep and no cooking
	          allowed.
	          And just how many of these tootsies
	          make that kind of money and have to
	          eat in restaurants and buy clothes
	          and --
	
	Roy, carrying his junk mail and pretending not to be in pain,
	crosses to Simms.
	
	                    ROY
	          Mr. Simms.
	
	                    SIMMS
	              (fawning)
	          Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a
	          potential new neighbor, looking at--
	
	                    ROY
	              (uninterested)
	          Uh-huh. Mrs. Langtry may drop by.
	
	Simms doesn't like Mrs. Langtry, but can't say so.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          I'll send her right up.
	
	Roy goes back to the elevator. Simms continues his monologue.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          I had my first hotel thirty-seven
	          years ago in Wichita Falls, Texas,
	          and that's where I began to learn
	          about women. They just don't make
	          the money, you see, not regular
	          they don't, and there's only one
	          way they can get it.
	
	Roy enters the elevator.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          Now, that Mr. Dillon there, that's
	          the fine type of person I have in
	          mind for here. Like yourself, I
	          have no doubt. He's a salesman,
	          regular as clockwork, has a suite
	          here. Fine man. Now, about these
	          women. At first, you know, they
	          just go out and do it now and then,
	          just enough to make ends meet. But
	          pretty soon they got that bank open
	          twenty-four hours a day, and then
	          you've got trouble. Hookers and
	          hotellin' just don't mix.
	          You'd think the cops'd be too busy
	          catching real criminals, not
	          snooping around after working
	          girls, but that's the way the gravy
	          stains, as the saying is, and I
	          don't fight it. An ounce of
	          prevention is my motto.
	
	Myra enters from the front, looks across at Simms, points
	upward. Simms calls to her.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          Oh, yes, Mrs. Langtry, he's up
	          there, he's expecting you.
	
	Myra crosses to the elevator. Simms speaks more softly.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          If you keep out the women in the
	          first place, see, you keep out the
	          hookers, and then you keep out the
	          cops, and that's how you have a
	          clean place.
	
	EXT. ROY'S APARTMENT - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE along the balcony, with Roy's apartment door in f.g.
	and Los Angeles in b.g. Myra crosses to the door, opens it
	with her key, enters.
	
	INT. BATHROOM - DAY
	
	A small crowded old-fashioned bathroom. Roy, shirt open and
	trousers pushed down almost to his crotch, looks in the
	mirror at purplish greenish bruises on his stomach. He
	touches his stomach, winces.
	
	                    MYRA (O.S.)
	          Roy?
	
	He looks at the door, then grins at his reflection.
	
	                    ROY
	          Your medicine is here.
	
	He leaves the bathroom.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
	
	Hotel furniture, shabby and anonymous. On the walls,
	contrasting with everything else, are two crying-clown
	pictures on black velvet, mounted in big boxy frames. Myra
	stands in the middle of the room, and Roy enters, shirt and
	trousers still disarranged.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (amused by clothing)
	          Well, well. In a real hurry, are
	          we?
	
	                    ROY
	          Always, for you, baby.
	
	He reaches for her, but she playfully holds him off.
	
	                    MYRA
	          You aren't taking me for granted,
	          are you?
	
	                    ROY
	          Taking you for granite?
	
	He grins, as his fingertip prods her breast.
	
	                    ROY
	          That isn't granite. If that fell on
	          me, it wouldn't hurt at all.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (playing along)
	          Are you sure?
	
	                    ROY
	              (pulling her close)
	          Let's find out.
	
	EXT. HIGHWAY PHONE BOOTH - DAY
	
	Lilly's white Chrysler is parked next to an open-air phone.
	Traffic whizzes by. Lilly talks on the phone, with pen and
	notebook at the ready. The racetrack is visible in the b.g.
	
	                    LILLY
	          I'm done here. Do I come back to
	          Baltimore?
	
	INT. OFFICE - DAY
	
	It could be an expensive, if gaudy, lawyer's office.
	Baltimore harbor is visible past the windows. IRV, the
	accountant, sits at a desk covered -- but neatly covered --
	with ledgers, computer printouts, etc. He speaks on the
	phone.
	
	                    IRV
	          Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
	
	INTERCUT PHONE BOOTH AND OFFICE
	
	                    LILLY
	          Delmar? I never go out to
	          California. That's a thousand miles
	          from here.
	
	                    IRV
	          Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody
	          to handle playback this time. Come
	          on, Lilly, you don't argue with
	          Bobo.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (fatalistic)
	          I know.
	
	                    IRV
	          Take two, three days. Call when you
	          get there.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang
	          gleez on the way.
	
	This is Lilly making the best of the situation. She listens a
	bit more, GRUNTS a farewell, hangs up, moves to her car.
	
	INT. BEDROOM - DAY
	
	Again, anonymous hotel furniture. Roy and Myra naked in bed,
	he on his back, she straddling him, both moving gently. He's
	half feeling pleasure, half unconscious.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Roy?
	
	                    ROY
	          Mm?
	
	                    MYRA
	          Look at me.
	
	                    ROY
	          Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Roy? It this all we have?
	
	                    ROY
	          All? It ain't bad.
	
	                    MYRA
	          No more than this? 
	
	He tries to concentrate on her.
	
	                    ROY
	          What are you talking abut, Myra?
	          Marriage?
	
	                    MYRA
	          I didn't say that. You aren't
	          marriage material.
	
	He keeps watching her, ironic, hips moving. Looking for a
	distraction, she notices the bruise on his stomach.
	
	                    MYRA
	          What's that?
	
	She touches it; he flinches back, in real pain.
	
	                    ROY
	          Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do,
	          throw me off my game?
	
	                    MYRA
	              (laughing)
	          No, baby. Come to Mama.
	
	She folds forward onto him. He puts his arms around her. They
	rock together slowly.
	
	EXT. MOTEL - DAY
	
	The same mountains in b.g. as at the track. Lilly carries two
	small bags from her motel room, puts them on the back seat of
	the Cadillac, gets behind the wheel, drives away.
	
	INT. BATHROOM - DAY
	
	Myra, dressed, primps at the mirror, surveys herself
	critically, is reasonably satisfied, leaves.
	
	INT. BEDROOM - DAY
	
	Roy lies supine on the bed, semi-conscious, half-covered by a
	sheet. Myra, casual, not noticing his condition, leans her
	head in through the doorway.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Wore you out, did I? It's a good
	          woman you can't keep down, baby.
	
	He moves fitfully, CROAKS an attempt at speech.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Have a good sleep, baby. Call you
	          tomorrow. 
	
	He sits up, trying to grin and be easy.
	
	                    ROY
	          Wait'll next year.
	
	AN ANGLE across Roy's profile, with open bedroom door beyond
	him. Through it, the living room and outer door can be seen.
	Myra crosses the living room, opens the door. Bright sunlight
	pours in, emphasizing the sweat on his face. She closes the
	door, and he gives up trying to smile. Gingerly, he touches
	his bruised stomach, winces.
	
	                    ROY
	          Damn that guy.
	
	He's going to get out of bed, but movement creates pain. He
	sits back against the headboard, looks around, reaches
	painfully to the bedside table drawer, takes a quarter from
	it, studies the quarter, feels it with fingertips, places it
	on the back of his left hand, slowly moves the soft pads of
	his right palm over it, then turns the quarter over and
	repeats. Then he takes the quarter in his right hand, flips
	it, slaps it down onto the back of his left hand, SPEAKS
	simultaneously with the hands coming together.
	
	                    ROY
	          Smack.
	
	He looks away, right hand moving minimally on left hand.
	
	                    ROY
	          Heads.
	
	He lifts the right hand, nods, then flips the coin again,
	looks away, moves the right hand slightly.
	
	                    ROY
	          Heads.
	
	Again he's right. Again he repeats.
	
	                    ROY
	          Tails.
	
	He's about to repeat when a wave of weakness comes over him.
	He sits back, gasping, but won't acknowledge the problem.
	He forces himself to flip the coin, misses catching it, finds
	it on the blanket, flips it again, slaps it onto the back of
	the other hand, looks away.
	
	                    ROY
	          Tails.
	
	Right again. He prepares to flip the coin, but then his hand
	sags onto the covers, his chin drops, his eyes glaze.
	
	                    ROY
	              (whispered)
	          How much can I bet?
	
	INT. PASSENGER TRAIN - DAY
	
	The train runs through a forest, tree shadows making a light
	and-dark pattern. Roy, four or five years younger, sits with
	a three-core-monte gang, consisting of a DEALER, a spectacled
	SHILL beside him, Roy facing the dealer, a ROPER next to Roy.
	On a briefcase on the dealer's lap are three cards, face up:
	An ace and two deuces. Across the aisle, alone in the seats,
	sits MINTZ, a conman in his fifties, pretending not to watch,
	but watching with amusement.
	
	                    DEALER
	          That's between you two. I got
	          nothing at stake here, I'm just
	          dealing.
	
	                    SHILL
	          What if we both guess wrong? You
	          aren't gonna take...
	
	The dealer turns aside, allowing himself to be distracted. He
	and the shill ARGUE nonsensically. The roper nudges Roy, then
	reaches out and crimps the ace. Roy's doing a wide-eyed
	bumpkin kid; he stares at the roper in delight and amazement.
	
	AN ANGLE on the shill, arguing with the dealer but looking
	toward Roy and the roper, then increasing the force of his
	argument.
	
	AN ANGLE across the amused Mintz at the roper whispering to
	Roy.
	
	TWO SHOT, Roy and the roper.
	
	                    ROPER
	          We got him now! Put down that big
	          bill you got.
	
	                    ROY
	              (whispered)
	          The fifty or the hundred?
	
	                    ROPER
	          The hundred! Hurry!
	
	                    ROY
	              (doubtful)
	          The ace is what I want?
	
	The roper's having trouble keeping his patience.
	
	                    ROPER
	          Sure it is!
	
	TWO SHOT, the dealer and the shill, fake-squabbling, Roy and
	the roper seen in b.g. between their faces, Roy finally
	bringing out his wallet, withdrawing a bill. Relieved, the
	dealer and the shill cut the crap.
	
	AN ANGLE on the group as Roy puts his hundred dollar bill on
	the briefcase.
	
	                    ROY
	          Is that okay?
	
	The shill pulls a messy wad of bills from his inner pocket,
	uses most of it to cover the bet.
	
	                    SHILL
	          You're damn right that's okay.
	
	                    DEALER
	              (picks up the cards)
	          Whoever finds the ace, wins.
	
	ECU, the dealer's hands, shuffling the cards at lightning
	speed. He deals the cards out face down.
	
	INT. BEDROOM - DAY
	
	CU, Roy's sweat-covered face, eyelids fluttering.
	
	                    ROY
	              (whispered)
	          Dark in here.
	
	INT. PASSENGER TRAIN - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE on the group. Roy squints at the cards, light and
	dark playing on his face.
	
	                    ROY
	          Too dark. I just can't see.
	
	Casually, but too quickly to be stopped, he reaches across
	and plucks the shill's glasses off.
	
	                    ROY
	          Let me borrow these, will you?
	
	AN ANGLE across Mintz, surprised and amused, at the group in
	b.g., in consternation as Roy puts on the glasses and looks
	down at the cards.
	
	                    ROY
	          Now, that's better.
	
	ROY'S POV: The glasses are 'readers.' Through them, a large
	gray 'A' can be seen on the back of one of the non-crimped
	cards. Roy's hand reaches out and flips it over. It's the ace
	of spades.
	
	INT. BEDROOM - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE across Roy toward the doorway. Roy, eyes closed,
	smiles in triumph, then winces in pain. Mintz partially
	appears, hovering beside the bed, grinning at Roy.
	
	                    MINTZ
	          I didn't teach you that.
	
	                    ROY
	              (whispered)
	          You taught me a lot. Then I
	          invented.
	
	INT. AIRPORT DEPARTURE LOUNGE - DAY
	
	Weary bored people sit around waiting. Roy, 17, lugging a big
	suitcase, walks through, takes a seat near Mintz, who's doing
	card tricks for his own pleasure. Roy watches, then moves
	closer.
	
	                    ROY
	          Let me see how you did that one.
	
	                    MINTZ
	          Scram. Go home.
	
	                    ROY
	          I can't. I just left home.
	
	                    MINTZ
	          You're too young. You should be in
	          school.
	
	                    ROY
	          I am in school.
	
	Mintz peers at him, taking an interest. Then he holds up the
	five of spades, shows it to Roy, puts it back in the deck,
	shuffles, shows Roy the deck.
	
	                    MINTZ
	          Where's the five?
	
	                    ROY
	          In your other hand.
	
	Mintz grins slowly, turns his hand over with the palmed card
	showing.
	
	INT. BEDROOM NIGHT
	
	Roy slumps, eyes closed, half-smiling, with the fever Mintz
	hovering. Roy's smile fades, his fluttering eyelids grow
	still, his face slack. The fever Mintz fades and disappears.
	
	EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE on a large sign indicating "Los Angeles" straight
	ahead. CAMERA PANS DOWN and around 180 degrees to face the
	several lanes of heavy Los Angeles-bound traffic. LONG BEAT.
	Hundreds of cars rush by. CAMERA PANS with Lilly's white
	Chrysler as it comes along in the stream.
	
	AN ANGLE through the Chrysler's left side window at Lilly,
	driving, concentrating, biting her left thumbnail. She
	becomes aware that's what she's doing, shakes her head in
	irritation: She's trying to break herself of this habit.
	Ostentatiously she tucks the thumb into her fist, rests the
	fist on top of the steering wheel, where she can keep an eye
	on it.
	
	HIGH ANGLE on the westbound lanes. The Chrysler passes. Soon
	it's out of sight among all the other cars. LONG BEAT.
	
	INT. BEDROOM - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE across the unmoving unconscious Roy toward the
	doorway. The apartment door beyond the living room opens,
	throwing light on Roy, who doesn't react. Lilly enters, in
	silhouette, closes the door, crosses toward the bedroom.
	(Until she speaks, we can't be quite sure who this is. With
	the similarity between herself and Myra, this could be Myra.)
	
	                    LILLY
	              (hesitant)
	          Roy?
	
	No reaction. Lilly, getting worried, moves closer, through
	the bedroom doorway.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Roy? You asleep?
	
	His head moves slightly. He barely has strength to speak.
	
	                    ROY
	          Myra?
	
	She moves forward to the side of the bed, only her torso IN
	FRAME. She touches a hand to his forehead.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (startled)
	          My God!
	
	She turns, hurries back to the living room, looks around for
	the phone, crosses to it, dials, SPEAKS. Roy's eyes open, he
	frowns.
	
	                    ROY
	          Lilly?
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
	
	Lilly, hard and fast and urgent, on the phone.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Tell the doctor I work for Bobo
	          Justus, and this is an emergency.
	          Don't worry, he knows who Bobo is.
	
	INT. BEDROOM - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE down toward Roy, from above, he's weak but troubled.
	Eyes closed, frowning, whispering.
	
	                    ROY
	          Go away, Lilly. Go away.
	
	Roy's eyes close. He looks dead. SLOW FADE.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
	
	The DOCTOR, a nervous heavyset man in his fifties, a drinker
	from the look of him, is on the phone in b.g., while Lilly
	prowls the room, looking at everything with distaste, then
	stopping to frown at the box-framed clown pictures. She
	doesn't get it. She touches one of the pictures, trying to
	understand. The doctor hangs up, turns to Lilly.
	
	                    DOCTOR
	              (lugubrious)
	          The ambulance is on the way, for
	          what good it will do.
	
	                    LILLY
	          What? He's going to be all right!
	
	                    DOCTOR
	          Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some
	          sort of accident. He's had an
	          internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding
	          to death inside.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Well, make it stop!
	
	                    DOCTOR
	          His blood pressure is under a
	          hundred. I don't think he'll live
	          to get to the hospital.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (icy, stern)
	          You know who I work for.
	
	He's uncomfortable, wants to dismiss that part of his life.
	
	                    DOCTOR
	          Yes, yes, but that's --
	
	                    LILLY
	          My son will be all right. If he
	          isn't, I'll have you killed.
	
	The doctor stares at her in astonishment, then in belief.
	SOUND of ambulance siren. To break the moment, he crosses to
	the door, opens it. Light bathes Lilly. The doctor steps back
	across the threshold, waiting for the ambulance. He looks
	back at Lilly, who stares at him.
	
	INT. AMBULANCE - DAY
	
	ECU, Roy, skin pallid, eyes closed and sunken, lips white.
	SOUND of siren LOUDER. SOUND SEGUES to CHILD CRYING. CRYING
	FADES.
	
	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
	
	A clumsy slum hotel fifteen years ago, with a tiny lobby, the
	DESK CLERK at a half-door in one wall. Lilly, at 24, enters
	from the street. This is a definite hooker, with bright
	maroon hair and a black-and-white miniskirt. She stops
	wordlessly at the desk for her key.
	
	                    CLERK
	              (handing key)
	          Your kid's in the back here. He's
	          crying.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Roy? He's always crying.
	
	                    CLERK
	              (sympathetic to Roy)
	          The kids beat him up, because his
	          home life is, uh, different.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (ironic)
	          I like you, too.
	
	The clerk shrugs. He doesn't like this tough broad. He turns
	and calls back into his office.
	
	                    CLERK
	          Roy, your mother's here.
	
	Roy, 10, comes reluctantly out to Lilly, sniffling and
	rubbing his arm.
	
	                    LILLY
	          So what's your story today?
	
	                    ROY
	          They twisted my arm.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (laughing lightly)
	          Only one arm?
	
	He tries not to cry, and shows her a space between his teeth.
	
	                    ROY
	          They knocked out my tooth!
	
	                    LILLY
	          Only one tooth?
	
	Roy's frustrated, unhappy, having nowhere else to turn.
	
	                    ROY
	          You always say that!
	
	Lilly won't take him seriously, but she relents enough to
	stop teasing him, and to pat his head, ignoring how he
	flinches away.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Come on, kid, let's see if there's
	          any food in the house.
	
	                    CLERK
	              (there's no food)
	          Hah.
	
	Lilly gives him a jaundiced look, walks Roy to the stairs and
	up. The clerk, scornful but sexually interested, watches her
	go.
	
	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
	
	ECU, Roy in a hospital bed, with more color in his face,
	breathing more normally. He begins to react to the sound of
	people speaking.
	
	                    MYRA (O.S.)
	          No, really, you're Roy's mother?
	          That's impossible!
	
	                    LILLY (O.S.)
	          Not quite. But I'm not sure who you
	          are, Mrs... Langtry, was it?
	
	Roy's eyes open, he looks toward the voices.
	
	                    MYRA (O.S.)
	          I'm Roy's friend.
	
	WIDE SHOT, Lilly and Myra facing one another across the foot
	of Roy's bed, in a two-bed hospital room. (The OLD MAN in the
	other bed sleeps through the scene.) Neither woman is yet
	aware that Roy's awake. Lilly looks Myra up and down, with
	obvious contempt.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Yes. I imagine you're lots of
	          people's friend.
	
	Myra moves one pace to the side, studying Lilly's face.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Oh, of course, now that I see you
	          in the light, you're plenty old
	          enough to be Roy's mother.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (sweet smile)
	          Aren't we all?
	
	                    ROY
	              (very weak, but amused)
	          Play nice. Don't fight.
	
	The women, startled, both move toward Roy, one on each side
	of the bed.
	
	THREE SHOT, Myra and Lilly both leaning over to look down at
	Roy's sleepy face.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Darling!
	
	                    LILLY
	          Roy. You're going to be all right.
	
	                    ROY
	          Sure I am. What made you turn up,
	          after all these years?
	
	                    LILLY
	          I'm working down in San Diego. Just
	          for a few weeks.
	              (awkward laugh)
	          Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost
	          son.
	
	                    ROY
	              (cold)
	          Nice to see you.
	              (turns to Myra)
	          What am I doing in here?
	
	                    MYRA
	          You were bleeding inside, honey.
	          Remember that bruise you had?
	
	                    ROY
	          You called the doctor, huh?
	
	                    MYRA
	              (reluctant)
	          Well, no, Roy. Your mother found
	          you.
	
	                    ROY
	              (tossing It away)
	          Oh, yeah?
	              (very casual, to Lilly)
	          Thanks.
	              (back to Myra)
	          How long do they say I'm in here?
	
	Myra's willing to fight with Lilly, but Roy's attitude toward
	his mother makes her uncomfortable.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Roy... Your mom saved your life.
	
	Roy turns his head, gives Lilly an ironic smile. Lilly waits,
	holding herself in.
	
	                    ROY
	          Yeah? Only one life?
	
	She nods, accepting that, but then responds.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Second time I gave it to you.
	
	Roy gives her a cold smile, then turns to Myra for the ironic
	explanation.
	
	                    ROY
	          I was kind of... inconvenient...
	          for Lilly.
	
	Lilly has nothing but contempt for Myra. To be humiliated in
	front of Myra -- and by her son -- is the worst thing that
	could happen to her. She makes as dignified an exit as she
	can.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Well... You're all right now, I
	          guess. I have to get down to the
	          track.
	
	                    ROY
	              (reluctant, but it's
	               necessary)
	          Thanks, uh, Lilly.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (awkward laugh)
	          Don't mention it.
	
	                    ROY
	          I guess I owe you my life.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (faint smile)
	          You always did.
	
	Lilly exits. Myra looks after her, curious.
	
	                    MYRA
	          "Down to the track?"
	
	Roy will not talk about this, with anyone. His response is
	cold, closing the subject.
	
	                    ROY
	          Her job.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (bright smile)
	          I want to know everything about
	          you.
	
	                    ROY
	              (easy grin)
	          You do. And once I'm out of here,
	          I'll remind you of the best parts.
	
	They smile flirtatiously at one another, both with their
	minds on other things.
	
	INT. BATHROOM - DAY
	
	Very messy, small. Myra showers. She finishes, emerges, wraps
	herself in a towel, opens the crowded messy medicine cabinet,
	removes cosmetics and other items, starts to tweeze her
	eyebrows. Doorbell RINGS. She looks irritated, ignores it.
	Long doorbell RING. Exasperated, she slaps the tweezers down,
	exits.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
	
	Another furnished apartment, this one with Myra's clothing
	and dishes and glasses and other junk all over it.
	She crosses to the door, pulls it open. The APARTMENT MANAGER
	enters; a sullen, nervous, heavyset man.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (angry, but defensive)
	          You heard the shower, didn't you?
	
	                    MANAGER
	          I don't care about that. This time,
	          I gotta have the rent.
	
	Myra forces herself to be more pleasant.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Joe, I thought I was gonna be all 
	          right by now, I just need a little
	          more --
	
	                    MANAGER
	          It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my
	          wife. She knows what's going on.
	          This time, I gotta have the money.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Joe, you know you'll --
	
	In gesturing, Myra "accidentally" loses the towel, then wraps
	it around herself again as the manager stares nervously away.
	She smiles, knowing she's got him.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Joe, could we talk it over? Do you
	          want a drink?
	
	                    MANAGER
	          My wife sent me here, Myra. For the
	          money. She's waiting.
	
	                    MYRA
	          I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock?
	          Ten?
	
	                    MANAGER
	              (trying to be determined)
	          This time...
	
	                    MYRA
	          We'll work something out, Joe.
	
	She strokes his arm, smiling. He flees. She smiles till he's
	gone, then looks worried, leans her head against the door.
	
	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
	
	Roy, very comfortable in pajamas and robe, sits in a
	wheelchair beside the bed, with magazines lying handy on the
	bed. Myra, irritable, paces beside him.
	
	                    MYRA
	          I don't see why you're still here.
	          You look healthy to me.
	
	                    ROY
	          I just do what the doctor says,
	          babe.
	
	                    MYRA
	          You're just comfortable, that's
	          all. You don't even ask to go home.
	          You just lie around, let your mama
	          take care of you.
	
	                    ROY
	              (truly astonished)
	          Mama!
	
	                    MYRA
	          Who else is paying for all this?
	          You badmouth the woman all the
	          time, but you sure do take the
	          payoffs she gives you.
	
	                    ROY
	              (insulted)
	          I'll pay Lilly back, don't you
	          worry about that.
	
	                    MYRA
	          I don't like to come here, Roy.
	          Every time I do, your mother comes
	          in and makes remarks.
	
	                    ROY
	          That's just Lilly's way.
	
	                    MYRA
	          And you never defend me. You're
	          afraid of her.
	
	                    ROY
	          Oh, don't be stupid.
	
	                    MYRA
	          You're a mama's boy, if you want
	          the truth. 
	
	This is so absurd, Roy doesn't know how to respond.
	
	                    ROY
	          Are you kid --? I hadn't even seen
	          her in seven years!
	
	Lilly enters, smiling in self-confidence. A large ugly burn
	is on the back of her right hand.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Should my ears be burning?
	
	                    MYRA
	              (surly)
	          They might as well.
	
	Lilly gives her a mock-admiring look.
	
	                    LILLY
	          I heard those skirts were coming
	          back.
	
	Myra's not quite up to direct confrontation with Lilly. She
	glowers at Roy instead.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Get well soon.
	
	                    ROY
	              (easy)
	          Every day in every way.
	
	                    MYRA
	          I'll see you when you get home.
	
	Myra stalks out. Acting as though Myra hadn't existed, Lilly
	puts her bag on the bed, takes mail from it.
	
	                    ROY
	          What happened to your hand?
	
	                    LILLY
	              (casually dismissive)
	          Just a little accident. I went by
	          your place, picked up your mall.
	          Just bills, I'll take care of them.
	
	                    ROY
	          I can take care of my own bills,
	          Lilly.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (indifferent shrug)
	          Whatever you say. The manager says
	          your boss called.
	              (crooked grin)
	          Really pulled the wool over
	          everybody's eyes, huh?
	
	                    ROY
	          What are you talking about? So I've
	          got a job. So what?
	
	                    LILLY
	          Stop kidding me! Four years in a
	          town like Los Ang-gleez, and a
	          peanut selling job is the best you
	          can do? You expect me to believe
	          that?
	
	                    ROY
	              (spreads hands; it's
	               obvious)
	          It's there. The boss called, you
	          said so yourself.
	
	                    LILLY
	          And that dump you live in! Those
	          clown pictures on the walls!
	
	This reference alerts and worries Roy, which he tries to
	hide.
	
	                    ROY
	          I like those.
	
	                    LILLY
	          You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball
	          clown pictures? Commission
	          salesman? It's all a front, isn't
	          it? You're on the grift, I know you
	          are. You're working some angle, and
	          don't tell me you're not because I
	          wrote the book!
	
	                    ROY
	              (defensive)
	          You're one to talk. Still running
	          playback money for the mob.
	
	                    LILLY
	          That's me. That's who I am. You
	          were never cut out for the rackets,
	          Roy, and if you --
	
	                    ROY
	          How come?
	
	She considers him. His expression is jaunty, daring her. She
	gives him a somber answer.
	
	                    LILLY
	          You aren't tough enough.
	
	He's afraid she's right. He covers the doubt with a display
	of self-assurance.
	
	                    ROY
	          Not as tough as you, huh?
	
	                    LILLY
	              (dead serious)
	          No. And you have to be.
	
	She holds up her burned hand, showing it to him.
	
	                    LILLY
	          You asked me about this. You really
	          want to know what happened?
	
	He isn't sure he does; but what choice does he have?
	
	                    ROY
	          Up to you.
	
	                    LILLY
	          My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus,
	          back in Baltimore. When a long shot
	          gets too much action, I have to put
	          money on that horse at the track,
	          because it's the only way to get
	          the odds down.
	
	                    ROY
	          Sure.
	
	                    LILLY
	          The first day of the Delmar meet,
	          there was a nag called Bluebell. I
	          should have been on it. But that
	          was the day after you came in here,
	          so I stuck around to see how you
	          were gonna be.
	
	He would speak protest, deny, explain, but she cuts him off.
	
	                    LILLY
	          That was my choice, nothing to do
	          with you. I took a chance, and it
	          didn't work out.
	
	                    ROY
	          Bluebell came in?
	
	                    LILLY
	          I sent Bobo ten grand of my own
	          money, like it was the winnings
	          from my bets. I hoped that would
	          cover me.
	              (shrug)
	          It didn't.
	
	EXT. DELMAR DAY
	
	AN ANGLE on the exit doors toward the parking lot. Lilly
	comes out, self-absorbed, then sees something ahead of her,
	falters briefly, keeps walking, tries a very shaky smile.
	
	REVERSE ANGLE, as Lilly approaches her car. BOBO JUSTUS, 50,
	a blunt hoodlum in a good suit and a civilized veneer, stands
	leaning against the car, arms folded, squinting behind
	sunglasses.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Hi, Bobo.
	
	                    BOBO
	          Did I buy you that dress, you piece
	          of shit?
	
	Lilly's scared, startled, but trying to figure out how to
	play this.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Well, I guess so. You're the guy I
	          work for.
	
	                    BOBO
	          You work for me, huh? Then I just
	          may flush you down the toilet.
	          Drive me to the Durando.
	
	Bobo gets into the passenger seat, while Lilly nods
	convulsive agreement and hurries around to get behind the
	wheel. The car jolts forward, then smooths, and heads for the
	gate.
	
	INT. CHRYSLER - DAY
	
	Driving along the highway. Lilly concentrates on traffic.
	Bobo heavily watches her profile, finally speaks.
	
	                    BOBO
	          Bluebell.
	
	Lilly's eyes briefly close, her shoulders sag. Then she goes
	back to the silent alert person she'd been. Bobo nods.
	
	                    BOBO
	          How'd you figure you were gonna get
	          away with that?
	
	                    LILLY
	          I'm not getting away with anything,
	          Bobo.
	
	                    BOBO
	          You're fuckin right you're not. How
	          much did your pals cut you in for
	          on that nag, huh? Or did they give
	          you the same kind of screwing you
	          gave me?
	
	                    LILLY
	          I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not
	          as much as I should have been, but
	          there was a lot of action on those--
	
	Bobo taps a fingertip against the side of her head to shut
	her up. She shuts up.
	
	                    BOBO
	          One question. Do you want to stick
	          to that story, or do you want to
	          keep your teeth?
	
	                    LILLY
	          I want to keep my teeth.
	
	                    BOBO
	          Now I'll ask you another. You think
	          I got no contacts out here? That
	          nag paid off at just the opening
	          price. There wasn't hardly a
	          flutter on the tote board from the
	          time the odds were posted. There
	          ain't enough action to tickle the
	          tote, but you claim a ten grand
	          win!
	          You send me ten thousand dollars,
	          like I'm some mark you can blow
	          off!
	
	                    LILLY
	              (terrified, broken)
	          Bobo, no, I --
	
	                    BOBO
	          You wanna talk to me straight up?
	
	                    LILLY
	          My son --
	
	                    BOBO
	          Your what?
	
	                    LILLY
	          My son was in the hospital --
	
	                    BOBO
	          What the fuck are you doin with a
	          son?
	
	                    LILLY
	          He left home a long time ago. He
	          was in the hospital, up in Los Ang
	          gleez, real sick.
	
	                    BOBO
	              (utter scorn)
	          Motherhood.
	
	                    LILLY
	          I never fucked up before, Bobo.
	
	                    BOBO
	          You expect me to buy this?
	
	It's time for Lilly to show tough, and she knows it.
	
	                    LILLY
	          You do buy it, Bobo. I cost you,
	          and I'm sorry.
	
	Bobo thinks this over.
	
	                    BOBO
	          I got a lot of people work for me,
	          Lilly. I can't have shit like this.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (begging)
	          It'll never happen again. I swear.
	
	                    BOBO
	          It happened once. With me, that's
	          making a habit of it.
	
	Lilly drops back to her final position; fatalism.
	
	                    LILLY
	          You're calling the shots.
	
	                    BOBO
	          You got any kind of long coat in
	          the car? Anything you can wear home
	          over your clothes?
	
	                    LILLY
	              (deadened with fear)
	          No.
	
	                    BOBO
	              (doesn't matter)
	          I'll loan you a raincoat.
	
	Lilly drives, holding herself together.
	
	EXT. HOTEL DURANDO - DAY
	
	A tall expensive hotel on the coast north of San Diego.
	CAMERA PANS with the Chrysler pulling in and stopping at the
	entrance, then PANS UP the balconied facade.
	
	INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY
	
	Living room of a high-floor suite. CAMERA FACES across the
	room to the balcony and the view of the ocean. Entrance door
	to one side. A supermarket shopping bag is on the coffee
	table. Two THUGS sit on the sofa, watching TV.
	
	The door opens and Lilly enters, followed by Bobo. The thugs
	immediately rise and switch off the TV.
	
	                    BOBO
	              (to the thugs)
	          Take a walk.
	
	The thugs leave the room as Lilly crosses to stand between US
	and the view, followed by Bobo, neither looking out. Lilly
	turns to Bobo, who abruptly punches her hard in the stomach.
	She falls to the floor.
	
	ANOTHER ANGLE as Bobo steps across her and goes over to close
	the drapes over the view. Lilly sits up, watching him,
	waiting obediently. Bobo looks at her.
	
	                    BOBO (CONT'D)
	          Get me a bath towel.
	
	She gets up, hurting, and hurries to the bathroom. Bobo sits
	on the sofa, crosses his ankles on the coffee table next to
	the supermarket bag. He takes out and lights a cigar. Lilly
	comes back with a large white bath towel.
	
	                    BOBO (CONT'D)
	          You ever hear about the oranges?
	
	                    LILLY
	          You mean, the insurance frammis?
	
	                    BOBO
	          Tell me about the oranges, Lilly.
	
	He kicks over the supermarket bag. Oranges roll on the floor.
	
	                    BOBO (CONT'D)
	          While you put those in the towel.
	
	Lilly's very scared. She drops to her knees, spreads the
	towel, crawls around gathering oranges while she talks.
	
	                    LILLY
	          You hit a person with the oranges
	          in the towel, they get big, awful
	          looking bruises, but they don't
	          really get hurt, not if you do it
	          right. It's for working scams
	          against insurance companies.
	
	                    BOBO 
	          And if you do it wrong?
	
	                    LILLY
	          It can louse up your insides. You
	          can get puh, puh, puh...
	
	                    BOBO
	              (impatient)
	          What's that, Lilly?
	
	Lilly pauses, bent over, tightly holding an orange.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Permanent damage.
	
	                    BOBO 
	          You'll never shit right again.
	
	He gets to his feet, leaving his cigar in an ashtray.
	
	                    BOBO (CONT'D)
	              (hard, impatient)
	          Bring me the towel.
	
	Fumbling slightly, she folds the towel edges together to make
	a bag, then stands, brings the towel to Bobo. He makes a
	production out of getting his grip on the edges just right.
	She stands as limp as she can, just wanting to get through
	this. He looks at her without expression, rears back with the
	towel, swings it forward, lets it drop open. Oranges roll on
	the floor. Lilly stares, wide-eyed, recognizing reprieve.
	Bobo tosses the towel behind him onto the sofa, then gestures
	contemptuously for her to pick up the oranges again.
	
	TWO SHOT, closer, as Lilly turns, bending toward the oranges,
	and Bobo picks up his cigar, then lifts a foot and kicks her
	flatfooted, hard, in the back. She sprawls on the floor. He
	follows and drops to his knees on her back.
	
	AN ANGLE close on Lilly on the floor, Bobo's knees grinding
	back and forth into her back.
	
	AN ANGLE on Bobo, grimacing as he bears down, pressing his
	weight onto her back. He leans forward, left hand bracing
	himself on the floor beside her head as he reaches down with
	the cigar held in his right hand and presses the ember
	against the back of her splayed-out right hand.
	
	ECU, Lilly, clenching her teeth, tears squeezing from her
	eyes, simply bearing it.
	
	AN ANGLE on Bobo, catching a bad smell, looking back down
	behind himself at Lilly's body. This is the result he wanted,
	but it disgusts him. He straightens up, still kneeling on
	her, puts the cigar in his mouth, doesn't like its taste,
	removes it, braces his left hand against her back while he
	lifts off her, getting back up onto his feet.
	
	WIDE SHOT, Bobo stepping over her, expression repulsed.
	
	                    BOBO (CONT'D)
	          Go clean yourself up.
	
	He puts the cigar back in the ashtray as she rises, cradling
	her burnt hand. Not looking toward Bobo, hobbling with knees
	together, she starts from the room.
	
	                    BOBO (CONT'D)
	          The raincoat's on the bed.
	
	She leaves. He opens the drapes, then picks up an orange from
	the floor and steps out onto the balcony.
	
	EXT. BALCONY - DAY
	
	Bobo stands looking out at the ocean. He enjoys breathing the
	sea air. He slowly peels the orange, dropping pieces of peel
	over the side.
	
	Lilly appears in the doorway, wearing a too-large man's
	raincoat. Bobo doesn't seem to notice her at first, then nods
	to her.
	
	                    BOBO
	          Almost forgot. That ten grand of
	          yours. It's in the envelope by the
	          door.
	
	                    LILLY 
	              (tries for animation)
	          Oh, thanks, Bobo.
	
	                    BOBO
	          You want a drink?
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I
	          still gotta drive back up to Los
	          Ang-gleez.
	
	                    BOBO 
	          See your son, huh? Well, that's
	          nice. A side of you I didn't know,
	          Lilly.
	
	Lilly chances taking a step out onto the balcony. It's vital
	that she encourage this forgive-and-forget dialogue.
	
	                    LILLY
	          He's a good kid. A salesman.
	
	                    BOBO 
	          On the square, huh? And how are you
	          making out these days? Stealing
	          much?
	
	Bobo's being jolly now. Lilly's scared, but has to be jolly,
	too.
	
	                    LILLY
	          From you? My folks didn't raise any
	          stupid kids.
	
	Bobo's joshing now. He raises a humorous eyebrow.
	
	                    BOBO 
	          Not skimming a thing, Lilly?
	
	                    LILLY
	          Oh, well, you know. I just clip a
	          buck here and a buck there. Not
	          enough to notice.
	
	                    BOBO
	              (honest approval)
	          That's right. Take a little, leave
	          a little.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          A person that don't look out for
	          himself is too dumb to look out for
	          anybody else. He's a liability,
	          right, Bobo?
	
	                    BOBO
	              (this is his creed)
	          You're a thousand percent right!
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Or else he's working an angle. If
	          he doesn't steal a little, he's
	          steeling big.
	
	                    BOBO 
	          You know it, Lilly.
	
	                    LILLY
	          You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I
	          don't know what there is about it,
	          but it somehow makes you look
	          taller.
	
	                    BOBO
	              (delighted)
	          Yeah? You really think so? A lot of
	          people been telling me the same
	          thing.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Well, you can tell them I said
	          they're right.
	              (looks at sky)
	          I better get going. Roy'll wonder
	          where I am.
	
	                    BOBO 
	          Worries about his mother, eh? Give
	          him a hug for me.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          I will. So long, Bobo.
	
	Lilly leaves the balcony. Bobo eats more orange, looking out
	at the ocean. His expression is stern but calm.
	
	INT. CHRYSLER - DAY
	
	Lilly drives along the highway, weeping, shaking, teeth
	chattering. Her hands are both high on the wheel, the back of
	the right hand developing a large red burn.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Lucky! Lucky! Oh, am I lucky.! Am I
	          lucky!
	
	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
	
	Roy's appalled and embarrassed and ashamed by this story; the
	surface result is, he's mad at Lilly.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Lucky? You call that lucky?
	
	                    LILLY
	              (simply)
	          He let me live. He let me be his
	          friend.
	
	Roy in his agitation wheels himself back and forth in the
	wheelchair, bumping into things.
	
	                    ROY 
	          You don't put up with that! Nobody
	          has to put up with that!
	
	                    LILLY
	          You do if you're where I am. Where
	          you want to be. How'd you get that
	          punch in the stomach, Roy?
	
	He closes down, sullen, not caring if she believes him or
	not.
	
	                    ROY 
	          I tripped over a chair.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (calm maternal advice)
	          Get off the grift, Roy.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Why?
	
	                    LILLY (CONT'D)
	              (faint smile)
	          You don't have the stomach for it.
	
	He stares at her, hurt and angry. She stares back,
	unflinching. Angrily, he spins the wheelchair around, his
	back to her.
	
	Now she's hurt. She shrugs, speaks indifferently to his back.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          I just give you your life. What you
	          do with it is up to you.
	
	                    ROY
	              (his back turned)
	          That's right.
	
	She hesitates, then stalks out, shutting the door.
	
	Hearing the door close, Roy spins around in the wheelchair to
	face where she'd been. He starts to get up, pauses midway.
	
	INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
	
	Angry, Lilly takes a step away from the closed door, then
	stops, looks uncertainly back.
	
	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
	
	Roy, on his feet now, stands still, indecisive.
	
	INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
	
	Lilly shakes her head, turns firmly away, marches down the
	corridor.
	
	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
	
	Roy makes an angry gesture, drops back into the wheelchair,
	spins it around and wheels over to the phone. Quick and
	angry, he makes a call. SOUND of ring; SOUND of click.
	
	                    MYRA  (V.O.)
	              (filtered; little-girl
	               flirtatious)
	          Myra here. Sorry you missed me.
	          Tell me how to reach you and I
	          will, just as soon as I can.
	
	SOUND of answering machine beep.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Babe, I'm gettin out of here, and
	          that's it. Let's take some time out
	          this weekend, go down to LaJolla,
	          hit the beach, have some fun.
	          Forget all this other stuff, huh?
	
	Roy hangs up, sits in the wheelchair looking determined.
	
	INT. MADERO LOBBY - DAY
	
	Simms talks with a MAID.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          Your difference between your folded
	          towel and your clean towel is a
	          trip to the laundry. When you're
	          cleaning those bathrooms, what you
	          do, you pick up the towel, you give
	          it a good shake and a good look,
	          and you say to yourself, 'Would I
	          dry myself on this towel?' If the
	          answer's yes, fold it.
	
	Roy comes out of the elevator, crossing toward Simms.
	
	                    MAID 
	          What if it's wet?
	
	                    SIMMS
	          Mr. Dillon! Welcome back! You look
	          fine, just fine.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Thanks, Mr. Simms, I'm feeling
	          fine.
	
	                    MAID 
	              (shy)
	          I'm glad you're better.
	
	Simms hands Roy a stack of mail.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          You're well liked around here, Mr.
	          Dillon. The entire staff will be
	          pleased to see you're back.
	
	Roy's touched and embarrassed by this reaction.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Well, thank you. And thank them.
	
	                    SIMMS 
	          Sickness comes to us all, Mister
	          Dillon.
	
	                    ROY 
	          That's true, Mr. Simms.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          We never know when and we never
	          know why. We never know how. The
	          only blessed thing we know is,
	          it'll be at the most inconvenient
	          and unexpected time. Just when
	          you've got tickets to the World
	          Series. And that's the way the
	          permanent waves.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Well, I'm back now. I just wanted
	          you to know. Gotta rush.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          Happy to see you looking so good.
	
	Roy crosses back to the elevator, enters it. Elevator door
	closes. Simms looks after him, avuncular.
	
	                    SIMMS (CONT'D)
	          That fellow could be a congressman.
	              (turns to maid)
	          If it's wet, you don't fold it. You
	          shake it, and hang it neatly on the
	          rod provided.
	
	                    MAID 
	          Yes, sir.
	
	EXT. SARBER &amp; WEBB - DAY
	
	A long low stucco building in an industrial section of Los
	Angeles. The company name is on the glass of the main door.
	KAGGS, a humorless hotshot of 28, dressed in short-sleeved
	white shirt and narrow dark tie, prowls the cracked sidewalk
	in front of the place, MAKING REMARKS into a small cassette
	recorder. Roy's Honda arrives and drives into the company lot
	at the end of the building. Kaggs watches, then goes on
	patrolling and TALKING into the recorder. Roy comes out to
	the sidewalk and heads for the entrance. Kaggs stops and
	watches him approach.
	
	                    ROY
	              (cheerful, confident)
	          Whadaya say?
	
	                    KAGGS
	              (uptight, minimal)
	          Hello.
	
	Roy continues on and enters the building.
	
	INT. SARBER &amp; WEBB - DAY
	
	A low rail separates the visitors from an area of desks with
	CLERKS typing or adding up figures or TALKING on the phone.
	Beyond them are floor-to-ceiling bins and shelves with narrow
	aisles between, in which more CLERKS move busily, filling
	orders or doing inventory. A great sense of activity and
	hubbub. Roy enters, looks around in surprise. A clerk at a
	front desk sees him, stands happily.
	
	                    CLERK 
	          Roy! Welcome back.
	
	                    ROY
	              (approaching him)
	          What's going on? This is usually
	          coffee break time.
	
	                    CLERK 
	          Not since Kaggs showed up.
	
	Other clerks, aware of Roy, come over with AD LIB GREETINGS.
	
	                    ROY
	              (happily basking)
	          Hey, yeah, I'm fine, everything's
	          great. What's this Kaggs? Sounds
	          like a disease.
	
	                    2ND CLERK 
	          It is.
	
	                    CLERK 
	          Troubleshooter from the main
	          office. Came out here right after
	          you went into the hospital, and he
	          ain't had a kind word for anybody
	          yet.
	
	                    3RD CLERK 
	          Nobody knows anything but him.
	
	                    CLERK 
	          He chopped off half a dozen
	          salesmen; won't wholesale to them
	          any more.
	
	                    2ND CLERK 
	          What kind of sense does that make?
	          They're all on commission.
	
	                    ROY
	              (unworried)
	          You think he'll chop me?
	
	                    CLERK
	          If he does, he's crazy.
	
	                    2ND CLERK 
	          Here he comes!
	
	The clerks all hurry back to their desks as Kaggs enters. He
	crosses to Roy, hand stuck out.
	
	                    KAGGS
	          Kaggs. Home office.
	
	                    ROY
	              (taking his hand)
	          Roy Dillon.
	
	                    KAGGS
	              (keeping Roy's hand)
	          I know that. Knew it when I saw you
	          out there. The best salesman here,
	          which isn't saying much. Want to
	          talk to you, Dillon.
	
	Kaggs moves toward the gate in the rail, still holding Roy's
	hand, to move him along. Roy stands still, which yanks Kaggs
	back. Kaggs frowns at him, releases his hand.
	
	                    KAGGS (CONT'D)
	          What's up?
	
	                    ROY 
	          That was a pretty backhanded
	          compliment. If I let people get
	          away with things like that, I
	          wouldn't be a good salesman.
	
	                    KAGGS
	              (brisk)
	          You're right. I apologize. But I
	          still want to talk to you.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Lead on.
	
	Kaggs leads the way through the rail.
	
	INT. KAGGS' OFFICE - DAY
	
	Small, crowded, efficient, with interior windows showing the
	aisles of bins. Kaggs leads Roy in, shuts the door, gestures
	at the second chair as he goes behind the desk.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          Take a seat.
	
	They both sit, Roy amused and observant.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          When I said you being the best
	          salesman here didn't say much, I
	          meant for us. I know your record
	          with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say
	          you're a top-flight man, but you've
	          had no incentive. No one walking on
	          your heels. Just a lot of half
	          asses, so the tendency's been not
	          to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing
	          the slobs, incidentally.
	
	                    ROY 
	              (dry)
	          So I heard.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          Makes no difference to me if
	          they're only on commission. If they
	          don't make good money, they're not
	          giving us good representation, and
	          we can't afford to have them
	          around. Ever supervise salesmen?
	
	                    ROY 
	          Just myself.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          That's right, you've had to
	          supervise yourself. This place
	          needs a sales manager. Somebody
	          who's proved he's a salesman and
	          can handle other salesmen. He'd
	          have a lot of deadwood to clear
	          out, new men to hire. What do you
	          think?
	
	Roy doesn't yet know he's being offered the job.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Sounds like a good Idea.
	
	                    KAGGS
	          I don't know offhand what your best
	          year's been, we can look it up. The
	          idea is, we'll top it by fifteen
	          percent.
	
	Now Roy gets it. He's startled, almost scared, thinks
	automatically of escape.
	
	                    ROY 
	          What? Me?
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          That's just the first year. If you
	          aren't worth a lot more than that
	          the second year, I'll kick you out.
	          What do you say?
	
	                    ROY 
	          Well, uh... No.
	
	                    KAGGS
	              (astonished)
	          No?
	
	                    ROY 
	          I can't take that job! I mean, I
	          mean, I can't take it right away.
	          I'm still recuperating, I just
	          dropped in to say hello, see
	          everybody --
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look
	          a little pale. How soon will you be
	          ready? A week?
	
	                    ROY 
	          But you need a man right now. It
	          wouldn't be fair to you to --
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          I take care of the being-fair-to-me
	          department. Things've gone to hell
	          this long, they can go a little
	          longer.
	
	                    ROY
	              (trapped)
	          Well...
	
	Kaggs gets to his feet, terminating the meeting.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          See you in a week, Roy. I can call
	          you Roy?
	
	                    ROY
	              (rising)
	          Oh, sure. Fine.
	
	Kaggs sticks his hand out for another shake. Roy obliges.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm
	          afraid.
	
	                    ROY
	              (distracted)
	          Perk.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
	
	Roy's place. Roy enters from the bedroom, carrying a
	suitcase, which he drops on the sofa. He goes to one of the
	box-framed clown pictures, takes it off the wall, puts it
	face down on the coffee table, removes two wing nuts holding
	the back, lifts off the back, and reveals stacks of money
	hidden inside. He takes two wads of money out, counting them,
	putting them on the coffee table, then fits the back in
	place, reattaches the wing nuts, and hangs the picture on the
	wall. Stuffing the wads of money into the suitcase, he
	leaves.
	
	EXT. UNION STATION - DAY
	
	A cab pulls up to discharge passengers. Roy and the DRIVER
	get out. Roy pays the driver, who opens the trunk to take out
	several pieces of luggage. Myra leans hesitantly out, as
	though afraid it's raining out there.
	
	                    ROY 
	          This really is it. Union Station.
	
	Myra comes out of the cab. She's feeling testy. Roy's in a
	good mood and ignores her bad temper.
	
	                    MYRA
	          I don't see why we have to take the
	          train.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Because it's comfortable.
	
	Myra and Roy burden themselves with the luggage.
	
	                    MYRA
	          What if we want to drive somewhere
	          while we're there?
	
	                    ROY
	          We'll rent a car.
	
	They start for the station.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Big spender.
	
	                    ROY
	          You ain't seen nothin.
	
	INT. TRAIN DAY
	
	AN ANGLE from outside the passenger car through the window at
	Myra, mulish, watching the scenery go by. Beyond her Roy's
	easy, content. He moves to get up.
	
	TWO SHOT, within the train. Myra looks questioningly at Roy
	as he stands.
	
	                    ROY
	          Stretch my legs. Come along?
	
	She's not ready to relent and enjoy herself.
	
	                    MYRA
	          No.
	
	                    ROY
	              (unruffled)
	          See you soon.
	
	He walks down the aisle behind Myra, who sighs and looks out
	the window again.
	
	INT. BAR CAR - DAY
	
	Four young SOLDIERS sit at a table in a rudimentary bar car.
	They're drinking bloody Marys out of plastic glasses and
	having a good time together. In b.g., several customers are
	clustered at the small service bar, waiting for drinks.
	
	AN ANGLE on Roy, at the service bar, looking back past other
	people at the soldiers. He gets his mixed drink, in a plastic
	glass, and turns away.
	
	AN ANGLE on the soldiers as Roy starts by. The train lurches,
	and Roy falls heavily against their table, slopping their
	drinks and spilling some of his own on the table.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Oh! Ow, I'm sorry! Oh, look, I
	          spilled your drinks!
	
	                    SOLDIER
	          That's okay, don't worry about it.
	
	                    SOLDIER 2
	          You okay, pal?
	
	                    ROY
	          Let me buy you a new round.
	
	                    SOLDIER
	          Hey, no, no problem.
	
	                    SOLDIER 3
	          You didn't like spill much at all.
	
	Roy firmly places his own glass on their table.
	
	                    ROY 
	          What are those, bloody Marys? Watch
	          this, I'll be back.
	
	He leaves, while the soldiers are still PROTESTING.
	
	INT. TRAIN - DAY
	
	Myra applies makeup, watching herself in her compact mirror.
	She becomes aware of eyes, and looks around.
	
	TWO SHOT, Myra and a BUSINESSMAN, sitting across the way,
	grinning at her. Myra registers him.
	
	CU, Myra, considering the possibilities. Then she shrugs,
	shakes her head at the businessman almost reluctantly, and
	goes back to applying makeup.
	
	INT. BAR CAR - DAY
	
	Roy now sits with the soldiers, eagerly listening to them
	talk. There are plastic glasses enough on the table for three
	rounds of drinks.
	
	                    SOLDIER 3
	              (to Soldier 2)
	          Yeah, but it was you like told the
	          sergeant your grandmother was dead.
	
	                    SOLDIER
	              (laughing)
	          Again!
	
	                    SOLDIER 2
	              (to Soldier 3)
	          And you jumped right in.
	              (broad imitation)
	          I'll drive him, Sarge, he's too
	          distraught.
	
	                    SOLDIER 4
	              (astonished)
	          Distraught? You said distraught?
	
	They all laugh, Roy laughing with them.
	
	                    ROY
	          Boy! You guys could've got in a lot
	          of trouble.
	
	                    SOLDIER 3
	          Nah. Old Sarge, he's slowing down.
	
	                    ROY
	          I don't know. I wouldn't take a
	          chance like that.
	              (looks at floor)
	          What's that?
	
	They watch as he bends, picks up one die from the floor,
	holds it where they can all see it, his manner open,
	guileless.
	
	                    ROY (CONT'D)
	          One of you fellows drop this?
	
	INT. TRAIN - DAY
	
	Myra walks down the aisle, demurely looking at no one.
	
	INT. BAR CAR - DAY
	
	Roy's getting to his feet, the soldiers protesting.
	
	                    SOLDIER 2
	          You can't buy every round!
	
	                    SOLDIER 3 
	          Like our turn!
	
	                    ROY 
	          Tell you what. We'll roll for it.
	          Low number buys.
	
	He hands the die to Soldier 2.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Go ahead. You roll for the four of
	          you.
	
	The soldiers are confused but agreeable, seeing this as some
	kind of fun.
	
	                    SOLDIER 2 
	          Here goes.
	
	He tosses the die on the table.
	
	                    SOLDIER 3 
	          That's a four!
	
	Roy picks up the die.
	
	AN ANGLE close on Roy, his eyes glittering, his fist with the
	die shaking beside his head.
	
	WIDE SHOT. Roy throws. They all look at the die. Roy spreads
	his hands; the good sport.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Told you I'd buy.
	
	                    SOLDIER 
	          It just doesn't seem fair, Tom.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Tell you what. Give me a chance to
	          get even when I come back.
	
	INT. TRAIN - DAY
	
	Myra reaches the end of one car, starts through.
	
	INT. BAR CAR - DAY
	
	AN ANGLE on Myra about to enter. She stops, looking through
	the glass in the door.
	
	Myra's POV: Roy and the soldiers rolling the die for money.
	
	ECU, Myra, absorbed, watching.
	
	Myra's POV: MOS through the glass. ECU, Roy's hand with the
	die. ECU, Roy's profile, his smile, his innocent distress
	when he wins. ECU, Roy's hand scoops money.
	
	ECU, Myra, smiling, pleased.
	
	INT. DINER - NIGHT
	
	A brightly lit Hopperish place. Lilly sits alone in a booth
	eating a bowl of chili and reading a newspaper folded beside
	the bowl. A DRUNK with a great deal of faith in his own charm
	sits with a male FRIEND at the counter, drinking coffee. The
	drunk keeps looking toward Lilly, grinning, COMMENTING
	playfully to his friend, who's bored by it all. Lilly doesn't
	seem to be aware of him.
	
	The drunk rises from his stool, turning toward Lilly,
	staggering slightly. His friend makes a small move to stop
	him, then shrugs and lets him go. The drunk makes his way to
	Lilly's table, leans on it.
	
	                    DRUNK 
	          Pretty woman like you shouldn't eat
	          alone. Whadaya wanna eat alone for?
	
	Lilly gives him a flat look.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Go away.
	
	She looks past him toward the WAITRESS behind the counter.
	
	                    LILLY (CONT'D)
	              (calling)
	          Could I have some coffee, please?
	
	                    WAITRESS 
	          Right away.
	
	                    DRUNK 
	          We could have coffee together. My
	          name's Kenny.
	
	Lilly looks over at the drunk's friend, who pointedly ignores
	the situation.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Your pal wants you.
	
	The drunk could turn mean; his gesture brushing away the idea
	of his friend is stronger than necessary.
	
	                    DRUNK
	          Let him find his own pretty woman.
	
	The waitress arrives, with the coffee pot and a mug. She puts
	the mug on the table, pours coffee.
	
	                    WAITRESS
	          This fellow bothering you, Ma'am?
	
	                    LILLY
	          Yes.
	
	                    WAITRESS
	              (to the drunk)
	          Why don't you go sit down?
	
	                    DRUNK
	          I'll sit here. Move over.
	
	The drunk wants to sit beside Lilly, who looks to the
	waitress to solve the problem, but the waitress stands there
	with the coffee pot, looking helpless. The drunk bends to
	slide onto the seat. Lilly, exasperated, rabbit punches him
	in the throat.
	
	The drunk, astounded and in pain (and not breathing),
	staggers back, flailing, hitting the waitress's arm so that
	she slops coffee on him as his feet tangle and he falls
	heavily onto the floor.
	
	Lilly, suddenly concerned, slides out of the booth.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Oh! Are you all right?
	
	She goes to one knee beside the drunk, who clutches his own
	throat with both hands, retching as he tries to inhale. Lilly
	looks up at the astonished waitress.
	
	                    LILLY (CONT'D)
	          I shouldn't have hit him that hard.
	          I guess I don't know my own
	          strength.
	
	The drunk's friend arrives and helps Lilly get the drunk to
	his feet. The drunk is breathing now, but shaken. He looks at
	Lilly with reproachful eyes. His friend transfers his
	annoyance at the drunk to Lilly.
	
	                    FRIEND 
	          You didn't have to do that.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (matter of fact)
	          I thought I did. You should take
	          better care of your friend.
	
	                    DRUNK
	              (mumbled)
	          Outta here.
	
	The drunk and his friend head for the exit, as Lilly turns to
	the waitress.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          I'm sorry a lady can't eat in here
	          without being bothered.
	
	The waitress is apologetic, and also in awe of Lilly.
	
	                    WAITRESS 
	          It won't happen again, Ma'am, I
	          promise. Dinner's on the house.
	          More chili? Dessert? We have lovely
	          pecan pie, my husband makes it
	          himself.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          That sounds nice. Pecan pie. Thank
	          you.
	
	Lilly sits down as the waitress goes back behind the counter.
	
	AN ANGLE on the waitress, as she puts down the coffee pot,
	brings out the pecan pie, prepares to slice it, pauses, looks
	with wonder toward Lilly.
	
	EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
	
	The setting is a wide porch or lanai pretending to be a 19th
	century locale; a mix of western and antebellum south; the
	usual tourist confusion of histories. The effect is both
	romantic and false. Roy and Myra linger over wine, near the
	end of their meal. Roy's relaxed, happy, expansive. Myra's
	pleased but watchful, the bird watching the worm.
	
	                    ROY 
	          You were right, I had to get out of
	          that hospital. Nothing wrong with
	          me any more.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (purring)
	          I'll sign that affidavit.
	
	                    ROY
	          Great to get away, take it easy.
	          Next week, I'll get back to work.
	
	                    MYRA
	          You already went back to work.
	
	                    ROY
	              (confused)
	          What?
	
	                    MYRA
	              (indulgent smile)
	          I watched you. Working the tap on
	          those soldier boys.
	
	                    ROY
	              (elaborate innocence)
	          Working the what?
	
	                    MYRA
	          Oh, come on, Roy.
	
	She mimes rolling the die, slowly, showing how it will roll
	out of her hand just so, then speaks to him as though to a
	bright child.
	
	                    MYRA
	          The tap. What you do for a living.
	
	                    ROY
	          I'm a salesman.
	
	                    MYRA
	          You're on the grift. Same as me.
	
	                    ROY
	              (demonstrating patience)
	          Myra, I'm not following this.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (demonstrating
	               exasperation)
	          Roy, you're a short-con operator.
	          And a good one, I think. Don't talk
	          to me like I'm another square.
	
	Roy leans back, studying her, thinking it over, makes up his
	mind.
	
	                    ROY 
	          You talk the lingo. What's your
	          pitch?
	
	                    MYRA 
	          The long end. Big con.
	
	                    ROY
	              (shaking his head)
	          Nobody does that single-o.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          I was teamed ten years with the
	          best in the business. Cole Langley.
	
	                    ROY 
	          I've heard the name.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          It was beautiful. And getting
	          better all the time.
	
	                    ROY
	              (skeptical)
	          Is that right?
	
	                    MYRA
	              (enthusiasm building)
	          It is, Roy! And now, right now,
	          it's the perfect time, the best
	          time since I've been in the game.
	
	EXT. DESERTED DOWNTOWN - DAY
	
	New skyscrapers are separated by blank fields or small older
	buildings. Almost no traffic. A white limo drives alone down
	the street.
	
	                    MYRA (V.O.) 
	          All over the southwest, you've got
	          these businessmen, they were making
	          money when everybody was making
	          money, they think that means
	          they're smart.
	
	INT. LIMO - DAY
	
	Myra, dressed expensively and fashionably, sits with
	GLOUCESTER HEBBING, a stocky businessman, sixtyish. Their
	manner suggests intimacy.
	
	                    MYRA (V.O.)
	          And now they're hurting. Everything
	          they had was because of oil.
	
	EXT. NEW BUILDING - DAY
	
	Glossy, but no people around. The limo stops, the mustached
	CHAUFFEUR hops out and holds the door as Myra and Hebbing
	emerge and cross to enter the building, Myra carrying an
	attache case.
	
	                    MYRA (V.O.)
	          They still got money, but they need
	          more money, and that's just the
	          kind of guy Cole and me like.
	
	INT. LIMO - DAY
	
	The chauffeur gets back behind the wheel, adjusts the
	interior mirror so he can see himself, peels off his
	moustache, scratches his upper lip, refits the moustache more
	to his liking.
	
	INT. ATRIUM - DAY
	
	This building has a central atrium with corridors circling
	it, waist-high walls on the atrium side, glass-walled
	elevators rising up through the atrium. Myra and Hebbing are
	visible in an elevator coming up to a high floor. It stops
	and they exit, moving down the corridor.
	
	                    MYRA (V.O.)
	          When the oil money was good, they
	          put up all these office buildings,
	          and now they're half empty.
	
	INT. OFFICE - DAY
	
	ECU, translucent glass in door with company name: COE, STARK,
	FELLOWES &amp; ASSOCIATES, STOCK BROKERAGE - London - New York -
	Dallas - Los Angeles - Tokyo. CAMERA PANS to follow Myra and
	Hebbing as they enter the office.
	
	AN ANGLE showing the well-furnished outer office, the
	attractive and competent RECEPTIONIST welcoming Myra as
	someone she knows, gesturing her through, Myra graciously
	accepting, moving on. Hebbing's impressed by everything,
	trying not to show it.
	
	                    MYRA  (V.O.)
	          They'll give you anything to move
	          in; first two months free,
	          redecoration, whatever you want.
	
	AN ANGLE in a clerical office, four CLERKS at well-equipped
	desks with computer terminals, hard at work.
	Maps and clocks on the walls indicate the world. Myra and
	Hebbing pass through.
	
	                    MYRA (V.O.)
	          They help you set up the store!
	
	AN ANGLE in the PRIVATE SECRETARY'S office, she on the phone,
	nodding and smiling at Myra and waving her through. Myra
	leads the way, opening a door marked HENRY FELLOWES, Partner.
	
	                    MYRA (V.O.)
	          I'm the roper, I go out and find
	          them and bring them in. Cole ran
	          the store, and he was the best.
	
	INT. COLE'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	Myra and Hebbing enter an office decorated with sleekly
	understated opulence; the view through large windows is of
	apparently-prosperous skyscrapers. Cole, a plausible rich
	businessman, happily greets Myra.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Mary Beth! As beautiful as ever.
	
	He lifts a dubious eyebrow toward Hebbing.
	
	                    COLE
	              (gentle disapproval)
	          I see you brought a friend.
	
	As Mary Beth, Myra has a faint southern-belle accent and a
	clinging flirtatiousness.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Mister Hebbing is my bodyguard, my
	          strong right arm. Gloucester
	          Hebbing, may I present my fine
	          stockbroker, Henry Fellowes.
	
	The men shake hands, Hebbing open and pleased and dignified,
	Cole clearly holding something back.
	
	                    COLE 
	              (to Myra; gentle warning) 
	          Mary Beth, what we have here, uh...
	
	                    MYRA
	              (gaily innocent)
	          Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about
	          it, how brilliant you are at making
	          money for your special clients!
	
	                    COLE
	              (alarmed)
	          Mary Beth, I hope you aren't
	          spreading this good news too
	          widely.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Well, of course not! I know how
	          dangerous this is. But I would
	          trust Mister Hebbing with anything.
	              (to Hebbing; suggestive)
	          Wouldn't I, darling?
	
	While Hebbing looks manly and flustered and pleased, Cole
	brings from under his desk a partially full gray canvas sack
	marked Federal Reserve Bank.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Well, I'll have to take your word
	          for it, Mary Beth. Here's your
	          money.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (innocent avarice)
	          Goody!
	
	Myra opens her attache case on the desk. Cole takes banded
	stacks of bills from the sack, packs them neatly in the case.
	Hebbing tries not to look envious and impressed.
	
	HEBBING'S POV: The top bill in each stack is a hundred.
	
	PREVIOUS SHOT. Myra takes a stack, riffles it for Hebbing's
	benefit.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Isn't that just beautiful?
	
	                    HEBBING 
	          Yes, it is.
	
	Myra returns the stack to the case, talks to Cole.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Henry, next time, couldn't Mister
	          Hebbing --
	
	                    COLE
	              (shocked)
	          Mary Beth! This has never been
	          anything but --
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Oh, I know, I know, and you've been
	          wonderful since I was widowed. But
	          Mister Hebbing has--
	              (to Hebbing)
	          -- you don't mind my telling him,
	          darling --
	              (to Cole)
	          -- suffered reverses. If he
	          could...
	
	She gestures vaguely, unable to describe the situation
	accurately. Hebbing fills in, bluff and hearty.
	
	                    HEBBING 
	          Top up the tanks, as It were. Until
	          this little glitch in the oil
	          economy comes to an end.
	              (man to man laugh)
	          Not that I understand exactly what
	          you do, not from Mary Beth's
	          explanation.
	
	Cole broods, studying Hebbing, deciding at last to trust him.
	
	                    COLE
	          Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you,
	          and if she told you the story
	          already...
	
	                    MYRA
	              (girlish laugh)
	          So here we are!
	
	                    COLE
	              (solemn)
	          Mister Hebbing, we are talking
	          about breaking the law here, I want
	          to be sure you understand that. No
	          one gets hurt, but the law does get
	          broken.
	
	                    HEBBING
	              (a real sport; laughing)
	          Well, that's what the law's for,
	          isn't it?
	
	                    COLE
	              (still serious)
	          And I don't just mean the SEC. We
	          could have the FBI breathing down
	          our necks.
	
	                    HEBBING
	              (suddenly serious)
	          I certainly hope not.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Loose talk is the one thing I worry
	          about.
	
	                    HEBBING
	          I can keep my mouth shut, Mister
	          Fellowes.
	
	Describing the scheme, Cole becomes increasingly
	enthusiastic.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Okay, then. Sit down, sit down.
	
	Hebbing sits on the sofa, Myra beside him, holding his arm in
	both of hers. Cole paces, describing.
	
	                    COLE 
	          The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours
	          ahead of us, New York one hour
	          behind. There isn't one hour of the
	          day when both are open. Information
	          moves, but it has to wait. Now, we
	          have a young fellow working here --
	          Do you know what a hacker is,
	          Mister Hebbing?
	
	                    HEBBING
	          One of those computer geniuses,
	          isn't it?
	
	                    COLE
	          You're right! And this boy tapped
	          into that main link between Tokyo
	          and the New York Stock Exchange. He
	          can give us, when it's really
	          useful, a seven second delay in
	          that movement of information. Do
	          you know what that means?
	
	Hebbing doesn't want to admit ignorance.
	
	                    HEBBING 
	          Well, you've got your information
	          ahead of New York, I see that.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Every once in a while, a major
	          change comes through.
	          We have seven seconds to take
	          advantage, put our buy order, our
	          sell order, into the computer in
	          New York before the Tokyo data
	          comes in.
	
	                    HEBBING 
	          Not much time.
	
	                    COLE 
	          We have to be ready. We have to
	          have the money, and we have to know
	          what the information means, and we
	          have to move immediately.
	
	                    HEBBING 
	              (impressed)
	          Seven seconds. I don't see how you
	          do it.
	
	                    COLE 
	          These machines -- They're in here.
	
	Cole crosses to an inner door, pushes it partway open, looks
	back grinning with his hand on the knob.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Want a look?
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
	
	INT. BARE ROOM - DAY
	
	A bare dusty room. A ladder leans against a wall, a paint can
	on the floor beside it. Only Cole is visible in the open
	doorway. He speaks back into the main office.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Come take a look. An entire-suite
	          of main-frame computer.
	
	                    MYRA (O.S.)
	          We're not really interested, Henry.
	
	INT. COLE'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	Cole remains in the doorway, luring Hebbing with a smile.
	
	                    COLE 
	          It's quite a sight. You sure?
	
	Cole's pushing this too far. Hebbing's thinking politeness
	requires him to look. Myra's nervous, her smile with an edge
	to it.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Henry, don't try Mister Hebbing's
	          patience. He knows what machines
	          look like.
	
	INT. BARE ROOM - DAY
	
	Cole smiles at the empty room again, looks back.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Well, if you're sure.
	
	He shuts the door.
	
	                    ROY (V.O.) 
	          Cole liked to take risks, huh?
	
	EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
	
	Roy and Myra at the table.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          He didn't think they were risks. He
	          was so good, Roy, he could just
	          play with the mark.
	
	                    ROY 
	          And when he got serious?
	
	                    MYRA 
	          He'd explain he had to have cash,
	          so there wouldn't be any paper
	          trail for the SEC. And a lot of
	          cash, or it wasn't worth while. The
	          least we ever took was forty
	          thousand, and the most was one
	          hundred eighty-five thousand
	          dollars! From one sucker!
	
	                    ROY 
	          I thought these people were broke.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They
	          had savings accounts, stocks to
	          sell, houses to mortgage. Sell
	          their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had
	          a lot of money, when they put their
	          minds to it.
	          Or when I put their minds to it. I
	          stayed with them, that's the
	          roper's job, made them get up every
	          penny they could raise, turn it all
	          over to Cole.
	
	                    ROY 
	          And a month later, the sucker calls
	          the cops and you're on the run.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          No no! He never calls the cops, not
	          after we give him the blow-off.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Yeah? How?
	
	INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
	
	Myra puts a blood-filled four-inch-square plastic package
	into her bra on the left side, then puts on a white blouse.
	
	                    MYRA  (V.O.)
	          Three or four days after Cole got
	          the money, he'd phone the sucker,
	          tell him he'd made the move.
	
	EXT. NEW BUILDING - DAY
	
	Myra and Hebbing hurry across the sidewalk from the limo,
	each carrying an attache case.
	
	                    MYRA (V.O.)
	          Our buy was in the computer, we
	          were rich, he should come collect.
	
	INT. COLE'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	Myra and Hebbing enter, Cole meets them, all happy.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Here you are! Two rich people!
	
	                    HEBBING
	          I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I
	          had moments I was worried.
	
	                    COLE
	          You brought a case? Good.
	
	Cole brings out the canvas sack from under the desk, reaches
	in, brings out a stack of bills. The door opens and two men
	in suits and topcoats and hats enter, one of them flashing a
	badge. (These are, altered, two of the clerks from before.)
	
	                    MAN
	          Hold it right there!
	
	                    COLE
	              (cool outrage)
	          What? This is a private office!
	
	                    MAN
	          FBI! Stock fraud, tampering with
	          Exchange communications --
	
	Cole suddenly loses all control, becomes a gibbering wreck.
	
	                    COLE
	          Oh, my God! No! The scandal!
	
	The second man approaches Hebbing, pencil and notebook at the
	ready, manner cold and tough.
	
	                    SECOND MAN
	          Your name?
	
	                    HEBBING
	          My --? I don't I only --
	
	                    COLE
	              (screams at Myra)
	          You! You and your goddamn big
	          mouth!
	
	                    KYRA
	              (terrified)
	          Henry, no, I --
	
	                    COLE
	          Who did you tell? Who?
	
	                    MYRA
	          Just one or two of the girls, just,
	          they wouldn't --
	
	Cole pulls a pistol from his desk drawer.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Don't move!
	
	                    MAN
	          Mister Fellowes, that isn't going
	          to do you any good. Put that down,
	          and --
	
	Cole ignores him, staring in frantic hatred at Myra.
	
	                    COLE 
	          You ruined me! You destroyed me!
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Henry, no!
	
	Cole shoots her, the SOUND very loud, the men flinching away.
	Myra slaps her hand to her breast; blood spurts between her
	fingers. In terror, she turns toward Hebbing, who stares at
	the blood seeping down her white blouse. She tries to speak,
	can't. She reaches out, her bloody hand sliding down
	Hebbing's front without getting any purchase, leaving a swath
	of blood diagonally across his jacket, shirt and tie. She
	topples forward. Hebbing tries to hold her, but she slips to
	the floor.
	
	Cole runs around the desk toward the door, waving the gun.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Get back! Get back!
	
	The men warily move away from the door.
	
	                    COLE 
	          I'll kill the first one that
	          follows me!
	
	Cole runs from the room. The two men pull guns from hip
	holsters under their coat-tails. Hebbing, kneeling beside
	Myra, watches them approach the door, crouch, run through.
	Hebbing rises, looks around, runs to the inner door, finds it
	locked. He crosses to the main door, looks out, cautiously
	creeps from the room.
	
	Myra sits up.
	
	INT. OFFICE - DAY
	
	Hebbing hurries through the empty secretary's office and out
	the other door. The two men enter from a different door and
	cross to re-enter Cole's office.
	
	INT. ATRIUM - DAY
	
	Cole stands behind a pillar, watching. Across the way,
	Hebbing comes out of the office, staring around, trying to
	wipe the blood from his clothes. In obvious panic, he runs to
	the elevator, presses the button.
	
	AN ANGLE through the glass wall into the elevator as it
	stops. The doors open, Hebbing hurries in, frantically jabs
	the button. The elevator descends. CAMERA PANS to Cole coming
	around the corridor, entering the office.
	
	INT. COLE'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	General hilarity. The secretary, two men, other two clerks,
	chauffeur and receptionist are all present, opening
	champagne, Hebbing's money now out of the sack and spread on
	the desk. Myra, stripped to the waist (unconcerned about the
	others present) cleans blood from her breasts with damp
	towels. He and Myra look at one another across the room,
	broadly smile.
	
	EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
	
	Myra's very up, from reliving this story.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Oh, Roy, it was great! We were
	          rolling in dough, lived wherever we
	          wanted, only pulled two or three
	          scams a year.
	
	                    ROY 
	          What happened to Cole?
	
	                    MYRA
	              (suddenly evasive)
	          He retired.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Where?
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Upstate.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Upstate where?
	
	                    MYRA
	          Atascadero.
	
	                    ROY 
	          That's where they keep the
	          criminally insane, isn't it?
	
	Myra turns her face away.
	
	INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
	
	Expensive room. Cole, naked, expression haunted and crazed,
	sits cross-legged on the bed. Myra enters, happy, carrying
	dress shop boxes. She stops, shocked, when she sees Cole.
	
	                    MYRA
	          No, baby. Not again.
	
	He stares at the floor over the edge of the bed, like a
	shipwreck victim in a raft looking at the sea.
	
	                    COLE
	          It's hollow. You'll fall through.
	
	Myra drops the packages on a chair.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
	
	                    COLE 
	              (frightened but
	               determined)
	          Can't move.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          It's just the strain again, the
	          stress. We'll take a vacation.
	
	                    COLE
	          It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
	
	She approaches him, scared but needing him.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Cole, you scare me when this
	          happens. One of these times...
	
	She touches him. He suddenly lashes out, knocking her
	backward, glaring at her.
	
	                    COLE 
	          Demon! Demon! That's why you can
	          walk on it! Demon!
	
	                    MYRA
	              (heartbroken)
	          Oh, Cole, please. Please come out
	          of it. What would I do without you?
	
	Distracted, gone, unaware of her existence, he gazes around,
	hugs himself, sits staring at demons. She watches him,
	mournful, knowing he's gone.
	
	EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
	
	Myra looks back at Roy. Her expression makes it clear she
	isn't going to tell him any more than she already has.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          He retired, and that's it. But I
	          didn't. I'm still the best long-con
	          roper you'll ever see.
	
	Roy laughs, genuinely pleased by her and also tacitly letting
	his questions drop.
	
	                    ROY 
	          I just bet you are, too. And now
	          you're trying to rope me.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (pushing enthusiasm)
	          Join up with you! I watched you,
	          Roy, I've been watching you,
	          wondering if I should talk about
	          this at all, or maybe just...
	              (shrug)
	
	                    ROY 
	          Take a hike, you mean?
	
	                    MYRA 
	          I need a partner, Roy. I need an
	          inside man, and you're it. You
	          could be as wonderful as Cole.
	
	                    ROY 
	              (dubious)
	          I don't know, Myra, I never had
	          partners. I never needed them.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Not to take soldiers for a hundred
	          bucks. But how about taking a bank
	          president for a hundred grand?
	
	Roy doesn't like this; he's feeling pressured. Myra sees it,
	but believes she's got him anyway, so she can let up. She
	pats his hand.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Think about it. Okay?
	
	                    ROY
	              (easy to promise)
	          Sure.
	
	INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
	
	A little drunk and happy, Roy and Myra come down the corridor
	together, then make it obvious they're going into separate
	rooms, across the corridor from one another.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (coy, sexy)
	          See you later.
	
	Roy complains, but half-heartedly, half humorously; this
	argument has already taken place.
	
	                    ROY 
	          I still don't see why we have to
	          have separate rooms. You expect
	          your father to come through?
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Separate bathrooms, darling. I will
	          not lay out all my cosmetics for
	          you to knock over.
	
	                    ROY
	              (nevertheless grumpy)
	          Things a man isn't supposed to
	          know.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (soothing)
	          You don't mind, really, do you,
	          Roy? It's been such a wonderful
	          evening, I guess I just wore myself
	          out.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Sure. I'm pretty tired myself.
	
	They unlock the opposing doors, look back at one another.
	Myra's smile and good-night wave are consciously cute. Roy's
	response is a little forced. They go into their rooms.
	
	INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Once he's alone, Roy stops trying to look like a good sport.
	Disgusted, he tosses the room key onto the dresser, then
	crosses to sliding glass doors closed in front of a balcony.
	He's about to close the drapes when he looks out, changes his
	mind, unlocks and opens the door. He steps outside.
	
	EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT
	
	A high floor, with a wide view of ocean and starry sky. Roy
	leans on the rail, looking out, thinking. He mutters to
	himself.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Long con. I'm the one's been
	          conned. Who needs this?
	
	He continues to stand there, taking some solace from the
	night. BEAT. Phone RINGS. Confused, irritated, he turns to
	look into the room. Phone RINGS. At last, he goes back into
	the room.
	
	INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Roy crosses to pick up the phone, grumpy and suspicious.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Yeah?
	
	                    MYRA (V.O.)
	              (filtered)
	          Open your door.
	
	                    ROY 
	          What?
	              (grins; gets it)
	          What for?
	
	                    MYRA (V.O.) 
	              (filtered)
	          Open it and find out.
	
	Roy hangs up and crosses to the door.
	
	AN ANGLE directly at the door as Roy opens it, showing Myra's
	door open across the way, Myra standing in her doorway naked.
	She waves at him to move over.
	
	                    MYRA (CONT'D)
	          Gangway!
	
	Roy steps back, holding his door open.
	
	INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
	
	AN ANGLE down the hall as Myra skips across from her room to
	Roy's, her door slamming behind her.
	
	INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Myra runs in, giggling. Roy shuts the door, laughing at her.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (coquettish)
	          I hope you don't mind, sir. I just
	          washed my clothes, and I couldn't
	          do a thing with them.
	
	Roy's pleased, but at a loss.
	
	                    ROY 
	          You -- I don't know.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (sudden burst of laughter)
	               )
	          If you could have seen your face
	          when I told you good night! You
	          looked so, so... Ah!
	
	                    ROY 
	          Oh, come here.
	
	They embrace.
	
	INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
	
	A clean anonymous Holiday Inn. Lilly, dressed for the track,
	sits at the round table under the swag light, sorting through
	her business purse. There's a folded newspaper on the table.
	KNOCK on the door. She's startled. For just a second, she's
	like a trapped animal. Then she's calm again. She turns the
	purse around, opens another zipper section, removes a pistol
	and a silencer, quickly screws the silencer onto the pistol,
	lays the pistol on the table and covers it with the
	newspaper. Then she crosses to open the door.
	
	AN ANGLE to include Roy in the doorway, grinning, easy.
	Lilly's surprised, pleased, but wary.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Roy! What are you doing in San
	          Diego?
	
	                    ROY
	              (entering)
	          Myra and me come down to LaJolla
	          for the weekend.
	
	Lilly makes a face, but no comment, at Myra's name, as she
	closes the door.
	
	                    LILLY
	          If you come out to the track, don't
	          know me.
	
	                    ROY
	          We won't hit the track. The beach.
	          Couple a nice restaurants.
	
	He takes from his pockets the wads of money held removed from
	the clown pictures, extends them toward her.
	
	                    LILLY
	          What's that?
	
	                    ROY
	          Four grand. For the hospital. Is
	          that enough?
	
	                    LILLY
	              (distressed)
	          Roy, I don't want money from you.
	
	                    ROY
	          I pay my debts.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (level skeptical look)
	          You do?
	
	Since she won't take the money, he turns to put it on the
	table beside her purse, pushing the newspaper out of the way,
	revealing the gun. He gives it a surprised smile.
	
	                    ROY
	          Expecting visitors?
	
	                    LILLY
	          No. That was the point.
	
	She crosses to unscrew the silencer and put both pieces back
	in her purse. Roy, watching, points at the still angry burn
	on her hand.
	
	                    ROY 
	          You ought to put a bandage on that.
	
	                    LILLY
	          No can do. Have to dip in and out
	          of my bag too much. Besides, it'll
	          heal in the air.
	
	Disdainful and hurt, she pushes at the wads of money.
	
	                    LILLY (CONT'D)
	          Roy, take that back.
	
	His own hostility shows through.
	
	                    ROY 
	          No.
	
	She's not used to being vulnerable, can neither hide it nor
	really express it; can't use it as a tactic.
	
	                    LILLY
	          I thought... I was hoping we could
	          play it straight with one another.
	
	                    ROY 
	          I guess not. You'll be heading east
	          from here, huh?
	
	                    LILLY 
	              (dull)
	          After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Well... nice to see you again,
	          Lilly.
	
	                    LILLY
	          You, too, Roy.
	
	Roy finds this parting unsatisfactory, but has nothing to
	add. With a shrug, he leaves. Lilly looks after him, her
	expression becoming resentful, dully angry.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Prick.
	
	EXT. HOLIDAY INN - DAY
	
	Myra sits in the back seat of a taxi parked across the street
	from the motel. The door to Lilly's room is visible in b.g.
	Roy walks toward the street from Lilly's room.
	
	                    DRIVER
	          Here he comes.
	
	                    MYRA
	          I see him.
	
	Reaching the sidewalk, Roy turns to an empty cab parked on
	that side of the street, in front of the motel. Myra's driver
	shifts into gear.
	
	                    MYRA (CONT'D)
	          Wait. Hold it.
	
	                    DRIVER
	          That's the guy we're following.
	
	                    MYRA
	          Just wait.
	
	Roy enters the other cab, which drives away, as Lilly comes
	out of her room in b.g.
	
	                    MYRA (CONT'D)
	          Ah.
	
	Lilly gets into her Chrysler, backs away from the slot,
	drives to the street.
	
	                    MYRA (CONT'D)
	          Now we follow her.
	
	                    DRIVER
	          You're the boss.
	
	AN ANGLE on the two vehicles, as they leave the motel.
	
	EXT. DELMAR - DAY
	
	Where the surf meets the turf. Over the punters' heads, out
	beyond the track, spreads the Pacific Ocean, unnoticed,
	ignored. In every shot in this sequence, the ocean is visible
	but not looked at.
	
	AN ANGLE on Lilly, with her heavy shoulderbag, moving along
	empty tables, here and there picking up used tickets.
	
	AN ANGLE on Myra, on a different level, watching Lilly.
	
	AN ANGLE on Lilly at the betting windows.
	
	AN ANGLE on Myra, on a high vantage point in the stands. A
	MAN near her watches the field through binoculars. Myra ASKS
	if she can borrow them for a minute. Men are always happy to
	do Myra favors; the man gives her the binoculars. She looks
	at the field briefly, then turns and looks through the
	binoculars the other way, outside the track. The man,
	surprised, looks the same way.
	
	MAN'S POV: The parking area.
	
	PREVIOUS SHOT. The man looks in curiosity at Myra, who
	concentrates, adjusting the focus.
	
	MYRA'S POV: Foreshortened through the binoculars, Lilly opens
	the Chrysler's trunk, stashes money.
	
	PREVIOUS SHOT. Myra smiles, turns it into a sweet thank-you
	smile as she returns the binoculars to their owner.
	
	EXT. HOTEL POOL - DAY
	
	Roy dives into the pool, swims underwater to the ladder,
	climbs out near a YOUNG BLONDE on a chaise longue, who's been
	admiring him.
	
	                    BLONDE
	          You stay down real good.
	
	                    ROY
	          One of my talents.
	
	                    BLONDE 
	              (pointing upward)
	          Your mother's calling.
	
	Roy looks up.
	
	AN ANGLE to show Myra waving from her balcony, four flights
	up.
	
	PREVIOUS SHOT. Roy's at first surprised, then amused by the
	blonde.
	
	                    ROY
	          Naughty.
	
	He gathers up his towel and heads for the building.
	
	INT. BATHROOM - DAY
	
	Roy stands in heavy spray in the shower, half asleep, gently
	touching his stomach where the bruise used to be. KNOCK on
	door. He ignores it.
	
	                    MYRA (O.S.)
	          Roy! You drown in there?
	
	He rouses himself.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Be right out!
	
	INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
	
	Myra moves away from the bathroom door. She's in a bad mood.
	She paces back and forth, out onto the balcony, then back
	into the room as Roy comes out of the bathroom wearing a
	towel.
	
	                    ROY
	          You were gone for a while.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (casual)
	          I went out to Delmar.
	
	                    ROY
	              (suddenly wary) )
	          The track? Did you run into Lilly?
	
	                    MYRA 
	          I saw her.
	
	                    ROY
	          She didn't see you, in other words.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          I'm not trying to make trouble,
	          Roy. It's just, she's always so
	          nasty to me, I thought, who is she
	          to be so high and mighty. I saw her
	          out there, and I called a friend of
	          mine in Baltimore, so now I know
	          who she is.
	
	                    ROY
	              (dry)
	          You must have some very
	          knowledgeable friends.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          I'm well connected, Roy, Cole
	          introduced me to a lot of people.
	          Very valuable. Valuable for us.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Running your broker scam, you mean.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (enthusiastic)
	          You and me, Roy. What a team we'll
	          make. We think alike; we get along
	          together.
	          Once or twice a year we take some
	          slob, the rest of the time we live
	          like this. You won't regret this,
	          Roy.
	
	                    ROY
	          Regret what? I didn't say I was
	          coming aboard.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          But why not? I thought it was
	          settled. What's holding you back?
	
	                    ROY 
	          Come on, Myra, don't talk business
	          here. This is time out.
	
	She considers him.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          You mean, it would be too tough to
	          give me a turndown here. Easier on
	          home grounds.
	
	                    ROY
	              (shrug)
	          Yes or no. They're both easier at
	          home. Okay?
	
	Myra makes a visible effort to be accommodating.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Whatever you say, darling.
	
	INT. KAGGS' OFFICE - DAY
	
	Kaggs sits at his computer terminal, bringing up data, not
	pleased by what he sees. Buzzer SOUNDS. He swivels to the
	desk, presses the intercom button.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          Yeah?
	
	                    RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)
	          Roy Dillon, Mr. Kaggs.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          Good! Send him in.
	
	With a now-we're-getting-somewhere manner, Kaggs turns back
	to the VDT, punches up a different set of data, sits looking
	at it in gloomy satisfaction. Roy enters, and Kaggs rises,
	extending his hand across the desk. They shake hands.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          Good to have you back, Roy. I was
	          just looking at --
	
	                    ROY 
	          Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	              (keen)
	          You're turning me down? Makes no
	          sense, Roy.
	
	                    ROY 
	          I guess I'm just not a leader of
	          men.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          Oh, come on, Roy.
	
	                    ROY 
	          The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          Perk, remember?
	
	                    ROY 
	          Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I
	          like things the way they are now.
	          Pick my own hours, have time for,
	          uh, other activities...
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          A well-rounded life. I respect
	          that. But it has to have a center,
	          Roy, something you care about,
	          something you can think about.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Maybe I'm just not ready for that
	          yet.
	
	                    KAGGS
	              (deep sigh)
	          Well, Roy, if that's the way you
	          feel, I won't badger you.
	              (forced laugh)
	          Don't want to lose you as a
	          salesman, too.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep
	          everything the way it was.
	
	                    KAGGS 
	          That's what we'll do, then. But I
	          tell you what, Roy. Before I hire
	          anybody else, I'll ask you one last
	          time. Fair enough?
	
	                    ROY 
	          Fair enough.
	
	They shake hands.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
	
	Roy's room. He has one of the clown pictures face down on the
	coffee table. He takes money from his jacket pockets, crams
	it into the space, which is now just about full. As he's
	tightening the wing nuts closing the back, doorbell RINGS. He
	hurries, finishing the job, hanging the picture on the wall,
	then crossing to open the door. Myra enters, ebullient.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Darling, guess what? I had to tell
	          you right away.
	
	She gives him an enthusiastic kiss, then marches into the
	living room.
	
	                    ROY 
	              (grinning)
	          And hello to you, too.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          I called a fellow I know in Tulsa,
	          the one who plays my chauffeur.
	          There's a sucker there he says is
	          made for us. And a boroker that
	          just shut down, we can use their
	          office, not change a thing! Now, I
	          can scrape up ten grand without
	          much trouble. That leaves fifteen
	          or twenty for your end. We could
	          start this weekend, get the sucker
	          into position --
	
	                    ROY 
	          Wait a minute! When did this
	          happen, that we're partners?
	
	                    MYRA 
	              (bewildered)
	          What?
	
	                    ROY 
	          The last I looked, we were just
	          talking things over.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          But the setup's there. It's there
	          now.
	
	                    ROY 
	          I don't think I need it.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          You're too good for the small-time,
	          Roy. Move up to where there's big
	          dough to be made, and you don't
	          have to stick your neck out every
	          day.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Maybe I like it where I am.
	
	Myra's need breaks through her good sense.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Well, maybe I don't! I had ten good
	          years with Cole, and I want them
	          back! I gotta have a partner! I
	          looked and I looked and believe me,
	          brother, I kissed a lot of fucking
	          frogs, and you're my prince!
	
	Roy tries to treat this lightly.
	
	                    ROY
	          Don't I get any say in this?
	
	                    MYRA 
	          No! Because I --
	
	                    ROY
	              (pointing at her)
	          That's what I say.
	
	                    MYRA
	              (thrown off course)
	          What?
	
	                    ROY 
	          What I say is, no. We don't do
	          partners.
	
	                    MYRA (CONT'D)
	              (raging)
	          For Christ's sake, why not?
	
	                    ROY 
	          Mostly, because you scare the shit
	          out of me. I've seen people like
	          you before, baby. Double-tough and
	          sharp as they come, and you get
	          what you want or else. But you
	          don't make it work forever.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Bullshit!
	
	                    ROY 
	          No; history. Sooner or later, the
	          lightning hits. I don't want to be
	          around when it hits you.
	
	She stares at him, trying to find a chink in the armor,
	trying to find a reason, trying to find something.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          What is it? What's going on?
	
	                    ROY 
	          I'm happy the way I am.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          By God, it's your mother. It's
	          Lilly.
	
	                    ROY
	              (doesn't get it) )
	          What?
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Sure it is. That's why you act so
	          funny around each other.
	
	He frowns at her, not believing he understands her right.
	
	                    ROY 
	          What's that?
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Don't act so goddamned innocent!
	          You and your own mother, gah! You
	          like to go back where you been,
	          huh?
	
	He takes a step toward her, rising toward fury.
	
	                    ROY 
	          You watch that mouth.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          I'm wise to you, I should have seen
	          it before, you rotten son of a
	          bitch. How is it, huh? How do you
	          like --
	
	He slaps her openhanded but hard, and she staggers back. He
	pursues her.
	
	                    ROY 
	          How do you like this?
	
	He slaps her as hard with the other hand. Astonished,
	frightened, befuddled, she backpedals, bringing her forearms
	up to protect her face. He grabs her two wrists in one hand,
	holds them out of the way, slaps her forehand and backhand,
	forehand and backhand.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          STOP!!
	
	He suddenly gets control of himself, releases her, steps back
	into the middle of the room. He's angry, but also remorseful,
	sorry he lost control but still enraged at the enormity of
	her suggestion.
	
	                    ROY 
	          That's not like me. I don't do
	          violence.
	
	She cowers against the wall, peering in terror at him through
	her raised arms. He settles down, becomes heavily calm.
	
	                    ROY 
	          That's why we wouldn't work
	          together. You're disgusting. Your
	          mind's so filthy, it's hard even to
	          look at you.
	
	He crosses to the apartment door, pulls it open. Sunlight
	pours in.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Goodbye, Myra.
	
	She lowers her arms slowly, as though her whole body aches.
	She's still scared, but angry now, too. She'd like to tell
	him off, but discretion tells her not to. She moves across
	the room toward the open door, but stops, not wanting to be
	that close to him.
	Understanding, he backs away from the doorway, gestures with
	cold irony for her to proceed. She moves to the threshold,
	looks back at him.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          And you don't even know it.
	
	Angry again, Roy steps forward. She hastily steps outside,
	and he slams the door.
	
	EXT. ROY'S APARTMENT - DAY
	
	Myra moves slowly along the balcony, muttering to herself.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Mama. It's Mama. She's the one.
	
	She stops, holding the balcony rail, looking out at the city.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          You'll get yours, Mama. Oh, yes.
	
	INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
	
	Lilly's room; empty. Phone RINGS. Lilly enters, tired, with
	her shoulderbag; the end of her work day. Phone RINGS. She
	frowns at it, expecting nothing good, then drops the
	shoulderbag on the bed, crosses, answers.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Yes?
	
	A sudden smile doesn't entirely hide the wariness.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Roy! An unexpected pleasure.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
	
	Roy, troubled, paces while talking on the phone.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Lilly, I've got a couple things to
	          think about. Well, kind of job
	          offers, kind of. Different ways to
	          go. I'd kind of like to talk them
	          out, you know? Maybe just hear
	          myself talk.
	
	INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
	
	Lilly's delighted, but can't trust this moment more than any
	other.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Well, sure, Roy. You want me to
	          drive up --? Okay, fine, come on
	          down.
	              (kidding)
	          It won't be a home-cooked meal, you
	          know.

	                    ROY
	              (kidding)
	          Well, that's good news.
	
	He hangs up, but he's nervous, still uncertain, pacing.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Well? Who's a boy gonna talk to, if
	          not his mother?
	
	The sound of the question makes him laugh.
	
	EXT. MOTEL - DAY
	
	Myra's Cadillac eases to a stop across the street, where she
	earlier waited in the cab.
	
	AN ANGLE through the windshield at Myra, settling down to
	wait, looking at the motel.
	
	INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Lilly comes out of the bathroom, putting her lipstick away in
	a small purse. She's dressed carefully for tonight; upscale
	and respectable, without being stodgy. She crosses to the
	window -- night view outside -- and as she pulls the drapes
	shut the phone RINGS. She looks at it in disappointment,
	crosses to answer.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (expecting rejection)
	          Roy?
	
	INT. OFFICE - NIGHT
	
	Irv the accountant's office in Baltimore. He looks secretive
	and scared, talks in a hush.
	
	                    IRV 
	          Lilly, listen, it's Irv. You were
	          always decent with me, I'm taking a
	          hell of a chance here.
	          Somebody blew you out with Bobo.
	          The car full of money. He's --
	          Lilly?
	
	INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Empty. The phone receiver dangles off the table on its cord.
	The door finishes closing.
	
	EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT
	
	Lilly's Chrysler jounces out to the street, moving too fast,
	making the turn, racing away. CAMERA PANS to Myra's Cadillac,
	pulling away from the curb, following. CAMERA HOLDS with the
	two cars receding in b.g.
	
	INT. HONDA - NIGHT 
	
	Roy drives down a San Diego street, is stopped by a red
	light, looks at his watch. He's late.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Damn.
	
	INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Empty; as before. The door opens and the two thugs we saw
	earlier with Bobo enter, one putting a thick ring of keys
	away in his jacket pocket. They close the door, look around
	the room. One goes to the closet, opens it, looks at the
	clothing inside, while the other goes into the bathroom. The
	first crosses to the dresser, pulls open a drawer full of
	clothing. The second comes out of the bathroom. They look at
	one another. The guy from the bathroom shakes his head. The
	other one points at the dangling phone, speaks.
	
	                    THUG
	          Somebody spooked her.
	
	                    SECOND THUG
	          White Chrysler.
	
	                    THUG
	          Full of cash.
	
	They leave the room.
	
	EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT
	
	Roy walks toward Lilly's room as the two thugs pass him, on
	their way out. Roy knocks on Lilly's door, waits, knocks
	again.
	He tries to look through a crack in the drapes into the room,
	then turns to look at the empty place where Lilly's Chrysler
	had been. He shakes his head, knocks once more, looks at his
	watch, turns away.
	
	                    ROY
	              (disgusted)
	          Thanks a lot, Lilly.
	
	He walks off.
	
	EXT. ARIZONA MOTEL - NIGHT
	
	Lilly's white Chrysler pulls off the road into the front
	parking area of a new small motel. The car brakes to a stop.
	
	AN ANGLE from the road as Myra's blue Cadillac drives slowly
	by, while, in b.g., Lilly gets out of the Chrysler, moving as
	though she's stiff and tired. Lilly enters the motel office.
	
	INT. MOTEL OFFICE - NIGHT
	
	The CLERK, an elderly woman, turns away from a small TV set
	when Lilly enters.
	
	                    CLERK
	          Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Good evening. I'd like a single for
	          tonight.
	
	                    CLERK 
	          Oh, everything's the same size,
	          same price.
	
	The clerk extends a registration card and pen to Lilly, who
	takes them but doesn't yet start to write.
	
	                    LILLY
	          I'm a very light sleeper, traffic
	          noise keeps me wide awake all
	          night.
	
	                    CLERK
	              (sympathetic)
	          Those trucks. I know exactly what
	          you mean.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Do you have something around back,
	          facing away from the road?
	
	The clerk turns to consider the key rack.
	
	                    CLERK
	          I'll put you in one thirty-one.
	          Very quiet. Faces the desert.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Sounds perfect. I can park my car
	          back there?
	
	                    CLERK 
	          Right in front of the room.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Fine.
	
	She starts to fill in the registration card.
	
	                    LILLY
	          And I'll want to leave an early
	          wake-up call.
	
	                    CLERK 
	          No problem. My husband gets up the
	          crack of dawn.

	          It's his kidneys.
	
	EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
	
	Motel in b.g. The blue Cadillac, having turned around and
	come back, pulls off onto the shoulder of the road about
	fifty yards short of the motel.
	
	INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
	
	Over Myra's shoulder as she watches, through the windshield,
	the Chrysler parked in front of the motel. Lilly comes out of
	the office over there, gets into the Chrysler, backs it up,
	drives it out of sight past the motel. Myra puts the Cadillac
	in gear.
	
	INT. ROOM 131 - NIGHT
	
	A clean anonymous motel room, with two beds. Lilly enters,
	very weary, puts her shoulderbag on one of the beds, goes
	back outside and leaves the door open. She has backed the
	Chrysler into its spot just outside her room, so its trunk is
	visible through the open doorway.
	
	EXT. ARIZONA MOTEL - NIGHT
	
	AN ANGLE on Lilly as she opens the rear door of the Chrysler
	and leans in.
	
	INT. CHRYSLER - MIGHT
	
	Lilly wrestles the rear seat out of position, reaches down
	into the space under and behind it, and brings out a soft
	cloth overnight bag. It seems not too full but fairly heavy.
	She puts the bag on the ground outside the car and then
	pushes and prods the seat back into position.
	
	EXT. ARIZONA MOTEL - NIGHT
	
	Lilly shuts the car door, picks up the bag, and enters her
	room, shutting the door behind her.
	
	INT. MOTEL OFFICE - NIGHT
	
	Myra enters. The clerk looks at her in surprise.
	
	                    CLERK 
	          Something wrong?
	              (embarrassed)
	          I'm sorry. I thought you were the
	          other lady.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          No. I'm me.
	
	INT. ROOM 231 - NIGHT
	
	Lilly puts the bag on the bed with her shoulderbag. She opens
	the overnight bag, takes from it a blond wig, a pair of horn
	rim glasses and a passport. From her shoulderbag she takes
	the pistol and silencer. She attaches the silencer to the
	pistol and puts the pistol under the pillow of the other bed.
	
	INT. MOTEL OFFICE - NIGHT
	
	Myra's checking in. She fills in the registration card while
	the clerk considers her key rack.
	
	                    CLERK 
	          I'll give you one oh seven. That's
	          a very nice room, very handy, in
	          the front, right by the pool.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          Oh, don't you have something around
	          back, where it's quieter?
	
	The clerk sighs, looks at the key she'd taken from the rack,
	reluctantly goes back to consider the situation again.
	
	                    CLERK 
	          Everybody wants the back tonight.
	
	                    MYRA 
	          I guess everybody wants privacy.
	
	INT. ROOM 131 - NIGHT
	
	Lilly, in nightgown, yawning, comes out of the bathroom,
	switching off its light. The shoulderbag and overnight bag
	and overnight bag's contents are still on one bed. Lilly gets
	into the other, switches off the light.
	
	INT. ROOM 119 - NIGHT
	
	Virtually identical to Room 131. Myra enters, lugging a
	suitcase, and shuts the door behind herself. She puts the
	suitcase on one of the beds, opens it, paws through it, and
	brings out slippers, nightgown and robe. Briskly, she strips
	and puts on the nightgown, the slippers and the robe.
	
	Back into the suitcase, she brings out a small snubnose
	pistol which she puts in the pocket of her robe. Next out of
	the suitcase is a large ring of keys.
	
	Sitting on the other bed, she compares her room key with keys
	on the ring, takes three keys from the ring, and puts them in
	her robe pocket along with the room key.
	
	Getting to her feet, she crosses to the dresser, picks up the
	ice bucket, and leaves the room, closing the door behind
	herself.
	
	EXT. ROOM 131 - NIGHT
	
	CU, the door, with its number. CAMERA PANS to pick up Myra,
	approaching. She stops at room 132, looks at the Chrysler,
	smiles at it in proprietary fashion, and pats the Chrysler on
	the trunk.
	
	Then she turns to the room. She takes the keys from her
	pocket, looks around to be sure she's alone, and bends over
	the lock.
	
	INT. ROOM 131 - NIGHT
	
	In very dim light, Myra enters the room, closes the door,
	moves toward the beds. CAMERA PANS with her. Keeping her eyes
	on the sleeping form of Lilly, she puts the empty ice bucket
	on the empty bed, then moves closer to Lilly. CAMERA PANS in,
	moving forward as Myra's arms move forward, moving to CU on
	Lilly as Myra's hands (remaining IN FRAME) move forward and
	down. Her hands abruptly clamp on Lilly's throat. QUICK CUT.
	
	EXT. PHOENIX AIRPORT - DAY
	
	ESTABLISHING SHOT. A plane lands.
	
	INT. PHOENIX AIRPORT - DAY
	
	Roy, looking stunned, is among the deplaning passengers
	spreading out across the terminal. He's met by PIERSON, a
	plainclothes detective, and a uniformed COP.
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          Roy Dillon?
	
	                    ROY 
	          Yes?
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police.
	          I have a car here.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Thank you.
	
	INT. POLICE CAR - DAY
	
	The uniformed cop drives. Pierson and Roy sit in back.
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          I realize this is a shock.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          That's natural.
	
	                    ROY 
	          No. I mean, I don't believe it.
	          Lilly is not a suicide. I know my
	          mother, nothing would make her
	          check out.
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          I'm sorry, it was her all right.
	          Her gun, even.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Gun?
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          I grant you, it's a little odd,
	          shoot yourself with a gun with a
	          silencer on it, but it was hers,
	          all right. It really is your
	          mother, Mister Dillon.
	
	                    ROY 
	          It may be Lilly, but it isn't
	          suicide.
	
	                    PIERSON 
	              (interested)
	          Do you have any particular reason
	          to say that?
	
	                    ROY 
	          My mother... Well, I guess it
	          doesn't matter now. She worked for
	          gamblers. She always knew they
	          might turn on her some day.
	
	                    PIERSON
	              (thoughtful)
	          A hit, you mean. Honestly, it
	          doesn't have that feel to it, but
	          I'll certainly consider the
	          possibility. Thank you for telling
	          me.
	
	The car stops.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Not that it matters.
	              (looks out)
	          This is the morgue?
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          You up to it now?
	
	                    ROY 
	          Sure. Let's get it over.
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          One thing I have to caution you
	          about. A gunshot wound...
	
	                    ROY
	              (impatient)
	          Yes, I know, I know.
	
	                    PIERSON
	              (reluctant)
	          Well, uh, you know, she ate the
	          gun.
	
	                    ROY
	              (not understanding)
	          What?
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate
	          phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to
	          tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon,
	          this isn't an everyday occurrence
	          around here.
	
	                    ROY
	              (low; getting it)
	          Ate the gun. Oh.
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          Someone who knows her well could
	          still identify her, that's not the
	          problem. It's just there's, uh,
	          it's likely to be a shock.
	
	                    ROY
	              (opening the door)
	          Well, let's get the shock over
	          with.
	
	INT. MORGUE VIEWING ROOM - DAY
	
	A bare bright room with tiled walls, a few plastic chairs, an
	ordinary office door on one side and wide hospital swinging
	doors on the other. Pierson and Roy stand watching.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Not many laughs in this room, eh?
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          Not many.
	
	The swinging doors open and an ATTENDANT wheels in a gurney
	containing a body covered by a sheet. Roy braces himself. The
	attendant pulls the sheet away from the face.
	
	                    PIERSON (CONT'D)
	              (to the attendant)
	          Remove that. We'll want a full, uh,
	          identification.
	
	The attendant removes the sheet. The body wears a nightgown.
	
	AN ANGLE on Roy, swallowing bile, as he forces himself to
	move forward and look down at the face. He immediately looks
	away again.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Oh, Jesus.
	
	                    PIERSON 
	          No question, huh?
	
	                    ROY 
	          No, its -- Why did she--?
	
	He forces himself to look at the body again, his own face
	full of the unanswerable question. He looks her up and down,
	then his eyes stop. He focuses on something, a look of
	surprise coming into his eyes.
	
	Roy's POV: CU, the body's hands, crossed over the stomach,
	the wrists crossed, the palms down, the clear backs of both
	hands visible.
	
	CU, Roy. He knows. Sharpness comes back into his expression.
	
	                    PIERSON  (O.S.)
	          That's that, then.
	
	                    ROY
	              (starting to grin)
	          Oh, yeah. That's that.
	
	TWO SHOT, Roy and Pierson. Pierson wants to leave, but Roy
	stands over the gurney. He chuckles. Pierson looks at him,
	surprised and appalled. Roy ignores him.
	
	                    ROY (CONT'D)
	              (laughing quietly)
	          Mom.
	
	QUICK CUT.
	
	EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY
	
	MONTAGE. Myra's baby blue Cadillac drives, at extreme high
	speed, alone on the highway.
	
	EXT. MADERO APARTMENTS - NIGHT
	
	Myra's Cadillac drives slowly past, comes to a stop at the
	curb half a block away.
	
	INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
	
	AN ANGLE through the windshield at the driver, a woman,
	deeply weary. Her forearms are crossed on top of the steering
	wheel, her brow resting on the forearms. The burn on the back
	of her right hand is visible in illumination from a nearby
	streetlight. Traffic goes by. BEAT. Lilly lifts her head,
	looking out at the night. She's very tired, but determined.
	
	AN ANGLE beside Lilly, inside the car. From the seat beside
	her she picks up Myra's large dangly earrings and fixes them
	in place. Then she puts on Myra's big-lensed dark sunglasses.
	(She's wearing the clothes Myra wore when checking into the
	motel.) Lilly checks her appearance in the rearview mirror,
	then gets out of the car.
	
	INT. MADERO LOBBY - NIGHT
	
	AN ANGLE on Simms at the desk, talking to a TELEPHONE
	REPAIRMAN steadily at work fixing the switchboard.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          The last modern thing I liked was
	          the miniskirt. Your technology,
	          now, nobody understands it, and
	          that's the simple fact of the
	          situation.
	
	Lilly enters in b.g., crosses to the elevator, presses the
	button. Simms waves to her.
	
	                    SIMMS
	              (calling) )
	          Evening, Mizz Langley!
	
	The elevator door opens, Lilly boards and presses the button.
	The elevator door closes.
	
	                    SIMMS
	          New things come in here all the
	          time, how do they work? You can ask
	          your Ph.Ds, your highly educated,
	          intelligent, professional people,
	          you can say to them, how does that
	          work, and you know what they'll
	          tell you? You plug it in. And
	          that's the way the donut dunks.
	
	EXT. MADERO APARTMENTS BALCONY - NIGHT
	
	The balcony leading to Roy's apartment. It's illuminated by a
	light next to the public door from the interior hall.
	AN ANGLE on that door as Lilly cautiously opens it, looks out
	and around while remaining mostly behind the door, then
	focuses on the light. She reaches out and unscrews the bulb.
	GO TO BLACK.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Roy's place. Dark. SOUNDS of lock being picked. The door
	opens, showing only blackness outside, Lilly enters and shuts
	the door, then switches on the main light.
	
	Ah ANGLE on Lilly, in the middle of the room, distractedly
	biting her thumbnail as she looks around, calculating. She
	looks directly at something.
	
	Lilly's POV: One of the box-framed pictures hanging on the
	wall.
	
	PREVIOUS SHOT. Lilly, making up her mind, crosses to the
	picture and takes it off the wall. She finds it surprisingly
	heavy. She carries it to the coffee table, puts it down there
	on its back, sits on the sofa.
	
	AN ANGLE on Lilly studying the picture. She raps her knuckle
	against the sides, looks to see if the front or sides open
	someway, and finally turns the picture over, laying it face
	down on the coffee table. She sees how to remove the back,
	lifts it off, and looks at the stacks of money lying in
	there.
	
	CU, Lilly, almost fainting with relief.
	
	WIDE SHOT. Lilly looks at the other picture, looks again at
	the money, comes to a conclusion. She rises and leaves the
	room, deeper into the apartment.
	
	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Lilly switches on the light as she enters the room. She looks
	around, crosses to the closet, goes through the stuff in
	there, finds an old attache case on the shelf. She brings it
	out, puts it on the bed, opens it. Inside are a few decks of
	cards and a paperback book. She tosses them onto the bed,
	checks the case, finds that one of the clasps works but the
	other doesn't. One is good enough. She carries the attache
	case out of the room, leaving the light on.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Lilly enters, puts the case on the coffee table beside the
	picture, scoops the money out of the picture and puts it in
	the case. Then she unceremoniously dumps the picture on the
	floor.
	
	Lilly takes the second picture from the wall, puts it face
	down on the coffee table, opens the back, transfers the money
	to the case. She closes the case, attaches the one clasp that
	works, picks up the case.
	
	                    ROY (O.S.)
	          Hello, Lilly.
	
	TWO SHOT, as Lilly whirls around, terrified and then
	relieved. Roy stands in the open apartment doorway, blackness
	behind him.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Oh! Roy! You scared me.
	
	Roy enters the room and shuts the door.
	
	                    ROY
	          Going somewhere?
	
	                    LILLY
	          Somewhere else, that's for sure.
	
	                    ROY
	          I just came back from Phoenix.
	
	                    LILLY 
	              (anxious)
	          Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
	
	                    ROY
	          Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down.
	          Take a minute, tell me about it.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          I've really got to --
	
	                    ROY
	          You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Not for long. Not when they do a
	          fingerprint check.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Why should they? The cops are
	          satisfied.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Bobo won't be. He'll spend the
	          money to make sure.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Even so. You still got time. Relax
	          a minute, tell me what happened.
	          Sit down.
	
	He gestures at the sofa. Lilly's holding the attache case.
	The gutted pictures are lying around, one on the coffee table
	and one on the floor. She looks around at everything, awkward
	and embarrassed. But Roy hasn't said anything. And he's
	between her and the door.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Just for a minute.
	
	She backs up, sits on the sofa, puts the case on her lap. Roy
	pulls a chair over so it's directly between Lilly and the
	door. He sits, looking at her with polite interest.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Myra followed you, huh?
	
	                    LILLY
	          She must have been the one that
	          blew me off with Bobo. I guess to
	          get me running. Did you tell her
	          about my stash?
	
	                    ROY
	              (isn't worth discussing)
	          No.
	
	                    LILLY
	          No, you wouldn't. That's what she
	          was after, though. But why hit on
	          me?
	
	                    ROY 
	          I wouldn't go in on a deal with
	          her. She blamed you for it.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (a shaky laugh)
	          As though you do what I say.
	
	                    ROY
	              (cold grin)
	          That's pretty funny, all right.
	          What happened in Phoenix?
	
	Remembered emotion makes Lilly talk in little fast clusters
	of words.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Roy, it was terrible. You read
	          about people killing people and all
	          that, but when it happens, my God.
	
	EXT. ARIZONA MOTEL - NIGHT
	
	Myra, in nightgown, carrying the ice bucket, approaches Room
	131.
	
	                    LILLY
	          She was in her nightgown, you know,
	          the old grifter's dodge, nightgown
	          and the Ice bucket and she just got
	          into the wrong room by mistake.
	
	INT. ROOM 131 - NIGHT
	
	CU, Lilly asleep. Very dim light. The shadows shift on her
	face as Myra OUT OF FRAME approaches. Myra's hands ENTER
	FRAME, abruptly clamp on Lilly's throat. Lilly's eyes pop
	open wide, staring, her mouth stretches open. Myra's arms are
	locked straight, pressing her weight down onto her hands
	squeezing Lilly's throat. Lilly clutches at Myra's fingers,
	tries to reach Myra's face, twists and squirms, then suddenly
	lifts her arm up and behind her head, hand dipping under the
	pillow, coming out with the silenced gun, pushing the gun
	upward, straight-arm, the gun moving up OUT OF FRAME. SOUND
	of shot. Blood sprays Lilly's face. Myra's body drops down
	onto her, at an angle, so we can still see Lilly's horrified
	face over Myra's shoulder as Lilly gasps for breath.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Lilly stares across the room, breathing hard, reliving the
	experience.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          I sat in there with her, I thought,
	          what do I do now? Run and I've got
	          Bobo and the law after me. Stay,
	          and how do I explain?
	
	                    ROY 
	          This way's perfect.
	
	Lilly sits back, showing that relief again.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a
	          break for me after all.
	          I've been wanting out of the racket
	          for years, and now I'm out. I can
	          make a clean start, and --
	
	                    ROY 
	          You've already made a start.
	          Doesn't look that clean, though.
	
	Here's the awkwardness. Lilly looks guilty and embarrassed.
	
	                    LILLY
	          I'm sorry. I hated to take your
	          money, but --
	
	                    ROY
	          Don't be sorry. You're not taking
	          it.
	
	Lilly reacts as though he's slapped her. But then she gets
	her determination back. She splays out both hands, palm down,
	on the attache case on her lap.
	
	                    LILLY
	          I need this, Roy. I can't run
	          without money, and if I can't run
	          I'm dead.
	
	                    ROY 
	          You must have some money.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Just a few bucks.
	
	                    ROY 
	          And Myra's stuff?
	
	                    LILLY
	              (scornful)
	          Her credit cards. How far am I
	          gonna get with that?
	
	                    ROY 
	          Far enough. Maybe up to San
	          Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace
	          new. Start over.
	
	                    LILLY
	          At what?
	
	                    ROY 
	          You're smart, Lilly, and you're
	          good-looking. You won't have any
	          trouble finding a job.
	
	                    LILLY 
	              (appalled)
	          A job? I've never had a legit job
	          in my life!
	
	                    ROY 
	          Well, you're gonna start, if you
	          hope to live through this. A square
	          job and a quiet life. You start
	          showing up at the track or the hot
	          spots and Bobo's boys will be all
	          over you.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (exasperated)
	          Roy, I know what to do with myself!
	          It's a big world out there.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm
	          giving you good advice. I'm
	          following it myself.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (doesn't get it)
	          What?
	
	                    ROY 
	          I thought it over, and you were
	          right. You wanted me out of the
	          rackets, and now --
	
	                    LILLY
	              (bedeviled, aggravated)
	          Roy, that's fine, but I don't have
	          time for this. Bobo --
	
	                    ROY
	          I thought you'd be happy for me.
	          After all, you --
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after
	          me, and he's goddamn good! But so
	          am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I
	          survive.
	
	                    ROY 
	          I know you do, so that's why --
	
	                    LILLY 
	          And to survive, my way, I need
	          money.
	          Bobo knows about the stash in the
	          car, so I didn't dare touch it, not
	          if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that
	          leaves this.
	
	                    ROY
	          No.
	
	Lilly sits back again, brooding at Roy, trying to think how
	to get to him, how to get through him or around him. She
	sighs, licks her lips.
	
	                    LILLY
	          You want a drink?
	
	                    ROY 
	          I don't think so. You probably
	          shouldn't either.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice
	          water?
	
	                    ROY
	          Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
	
	                    LILLY
	          I'll get it.
	
	She stands, putting the attache case on the sofa next to
	where she was sitting. Roy, with a faint smile, watches her
	leave the room.
	
	INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	Very small, little used. Dark. Lilly switches on the light
	when she enters, then leans against the counter, fists
	clenched and trembling on the counter in front of her. She
	grits her teeth, hyperventilates, stares around the room in
	search of escape, an answer, something.
	
	CU, Lilly's face, desperate, grim, but not giving up.
	
	WIDE SHOT. Lilly opens cabinets, finds two glasses, opens the
	nearly-empty refrigerator, gets ice cubes from a tray, puts
	them in the glasses, puts the partial tray back in the
	freezer compartment, fills the glasses from the cold water
	tap, puts the glasses on the counter, stares at them briefly.
	She then shakes her head, searches the kitchen some more, and
	finds a cookie sheet she can use as a tray. She puts the
	glasses on the tray, carries the tray from the room, leaving
	the light on.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Lilly enters with the tray, crosses to Roy, presents the
	glasses, speaks as he reaches for one.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Take whichever one you want.
	
	He hesitates. It hadn't occurred to him Lilly might try to
	poison him or knock him out. He grins at her and takes a
	glass.
	
	                    ROY 
	          You wouldn't do that.
	
	Lilly takes the other glass, puts the cookie sheet on a
	table, looks down at Roy.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          You don't know what I'd do, Roy.
	          You have no idea. To live.
	
	                    ROY
	              (easy)
	          Oh, you'll live, Lilly.
	
	Lilly crosses back to the sofa, sits beside the attache case,
	pats it absently as though it is a pet and she's glad it
	didn't move, waited for her. She sips water, puts the glass
	on the end table.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          I know what's bugging you, of
	          course.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Oh? I didn't know anything was.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (twisted grin)
	          Oh, really? You've got a legitimate
	          complaint, Roy, I don't deny that.
	          I wasn't a very good mother when
	          you were a kid.
	
	                    ROY
	              (full laugh)
	          Not very good!
	
	She nods, accepting the correction.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          A bad mother. By any standards.
	          I've thought about it, you know,
	          from your side, since then. I know
	          just how bad I was.
	
	                    ROY
	              (closed against her)
	          Uh-huh.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          I wonder did you ever think about
	          it from my side.
	
	                    ROY
	              (not worth discussing)
	          Never.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          No, I guess not. It was pretty
	          lousy of me, I guess, to be a child
	          at the same time you were. Not to
	          stop being a child just because I
	          had a child. I guess I was a real
	          stinker not to be a grown-up when
	          you needed a grown-up.
	
	Roy didn't expect to be made uncomfortable and defensive, and
	he resents it.
	
	                    ROY 
	          What do you want me to do? Pin a
	          halo on you? You're doing a pretty
	          good job of that yourself.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          And making you feel bad at the same
	          time, huh? But that's the way I am,
	          you know, the way I've always been.
	          Always picking on poor little Roy.
	
	                    ROY 
	          For God's sake, Lilly!
	
	                    LILLY
	              (intense)
	          I gave you your life twice. I'm
	          asking you to give me mine once. I
	          need the money.
	
	                    ROY
	              (not worth discussing)
	          No.
	
	Lilly subsides back onto the sofa. One hand rests on the
	attache case. With the other, she sips water, puts the glass
	back down. Roy watches her, unmoving, expressionless. Lilly
	frowns, not quite looking at him.
	
	                    LILLY
	          You're getting off the grift?
	
	                    ROY 
	          That's right.
	
	                    LILLY
	          That's good. You don't really
	          belong on this side of the fence,
	          you know.
	
	                    ROY 
	              (amused)
	          I don't?
	
	                    LILLY
	          If you stayed a crook, do you think
	          you'd live to be my ripe age?
	
	                    ROY 
	          I don't see why not.
	
	                    LILLY
	          Well, I guess I got it wrong, then.
	          Seems to me I heard about a guy
	          just your age that got hit so hard
	          in the guts it almost killed him.
	
	Roy's again unexpectedly uncomfortable. He shifts uneasily in
	his chair, trying to think of a response.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Well, uh...
	
	                    LILLY
	          Sure, sure, that doesn't count.
	          That's different.
	
	                    ROY
	          Well, it doesn't matter, does it?
	          I'm getting out.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (intense)
	          And that's why you've got to get
	          rid of this money. If you keep it
	          around, it'll just make you think
	          how clever you are.
	          It'll be a temptation to get back
	          into the game.
	
	                    ROY
	              (full laugh)
	          Oh, that's it! You're stealing my
	          money for my own good! How very
	          motherly of you, Lilly.
	
	Once again, Lilly drops back against the sofa back. Another
	round in the fight is over. Roy watches her, patient, waiting
	for her to give up, seeing no other outcome.
	
	AN ANGLE on Lilly, frustrated, feeling the need to move, the
	pressure of pursuit. Her head turns back and forth, her body
	starts false gestures. Finally, abruptly, she gets to her
	feet, looks at Roy, looks away, picks up the attache case.
	
	CU, Roy, alert. He won't let her reach the door.
	
	AN ANGLE PANNING with Lilly as she prowls the room, pacing
	back and forth, the attache case swinging at her side.
	Finally, she stops, standing the attache case on the coffee
	table, her hand still on its handle.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Lilly.
	
	She looks at him, attentive without hope.
	
	                    ROY 
	          If I should get out of the racket,
	          that goes double for you. That's
	          why you've got to change your life
	          completely, go to some town, get a
	          square job, live like a john
	          yourself. If you try to do it your
	          way, what future is in it?
	
	                    LILLY 
	          A future. The only future I've got.
	
	                    ROY 
	          That money wouldn't last forever.
	          And then what? You'd be back in
	          some other part of the rackets.
	          Another Bobo Justus to slap you
	          around and burn holes in your
	          hands. This way, you've got to go
	          the square route. You could send me
	          a card when you're settled, I could
	          maybe help out sometimes...
	
	                    LILLY
	              (bitter laugh) )
	          That's what it is, isn't it? Keep
	          me down. Your turn to be in charge,
	          have the power.
	
	                    ROY
	              (stonewalling)
	          Just trying to help, Lilly.
	
	She sits on the sofa again, this time leaving the attache
	case to stand on the coffee table. She studies Roy,
	calculating.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          Roy... What if I told you I wasn't
	          really your mother? That we weren't
	          related?
	
	                    ROY
	              (bewildered)
	          What?
	
	Lilly leans back again, but this time her manner is
	different; languorous, sexy. She crosses her legs, the upper
	leg swinging gently. She smiles gently, encouragingly, at
	Roy.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          You'd like that, wouldn't you? Sure
	          you would. You don't need to tell
	          me. Now, why would you like it,
	          Roy?
	
	AN ANGLE on Roy, understanding and not wanting to understand.
	
	                    ROY
	              (hoarse)
	          What's that all about? Of course
	          you're my mother. Of course you
	          are.
	
	TWO SHOT. Lilly leans forward toward Roy, inviting him.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (very soft)
	          Roy... Roy
	
	Roy will not let anything complicated come to the surface.
	
	                    ROY 
	          There's nothing more to talk about.
	
	                    LILLY
	              (very soft)
	          I have to have that money, Roy.
	          What do I have to do to get it?
	
	AN ANGLE on Roy, his face bruised-looking, eyes scared. He
	will not know what's going on. He shakes his head, not
	trusting himself to speak.
	
	AN ANGLE on Lilly, leaning forward, tension showing through
	the seductive manner.
	
	                    LILLY 
	          No? Won't you give me the money,
	          Roy? Can't I change your mind? What
	          can I do to change your mind?
	
	TWO SHOT, as Lilly gets to her feet and takes a step toward
	him. Roy's pressed back into his chair, trying to maintain a
	cold facade.
	
	                    ROY 
	          Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?
	
	                    LILLY
	          Is there nothing I can do, Roy,
	          nothing at --
	
	                    ROY 
	          NO!
	
	They both turn away at the same instant. Roy turns to the
	side to pick up the glass of water, to break the spell and
	the tension. Lilly turns back toward the coffee table and
	picks up the attache case. Roy, lifting the glass to drink,
	turns forward again as Lilly spins forward, swinging the
	attache case at his head with all her might. The case crashes
	into the glass and into his face. Roy SCREAMS and topples off
	the chair, as the one remaining clasp on the case lets go and
	money goes flying, filling the air.
	
	AN ANGLE DOWN at Roy, face up, expression horrified, hands to
	his throat. A large triangle of glass is in his throat. Blood
	pumps thickly, fountaining up.
	
	CU, Lilly, staring down in horror. She lurches forward, but
	there's nothing to do. She stares around.
	
	ECU, wads of bills on the floor, getting bloody.
	
	CU, Lilly, in agony, but looking down, kicking.
	
	ECU, Lilly's feet kicking the bills away from the blood. 
	
	TWO SHOT, as Lilly drops to her knees beside Roy, who's
	already dying. Blood spurts less forcefully. His hands fall
	to his sides, eyes stare upward, mouth still moves slightly.
	Lilly, shoving money away with her hands now, stares at him,
	willing it not to happen. He stops moving. His eyes dull.
	Lilly clasps her arms around herself. She knows she doesn't
	dare scream. Lips drawn back in a snarl, teeth clenched, she
	HISSES her agony through her teeth. She HISSES; she HISSES;
	she HISSES. Then, slowly, she regains control.
	
	WIDE SHOT as Lilly gets to her feet. She seems dazed now,
	like someone who's just been in a traffic accident. She
	blunders around the room, kicks the attache case, bends to
	pick it up. She studies the clasp, sees it still works, goes
	back to her knees.
	
	LOW ANGLE, Lilly in f.g., Roy in b.g., as Lilly repacks the
	money into the case, wiping the blood from some wads onto the
	carpet. Finishing, she closes the case, then remains on her
	knees, bending over the case. She WEEPS grindingly.
	
	WIDE SHOT, entrance door in b.g. Lilly's weeping subsides.
	She gets wearily to her feet, and leaves the room. CAMERA
	HOLDS. SOUND of water running in sink. SOUND STOPS. Lilly
	reappears. She does not again look toward Roy. She picks up
	the attache case, crosses to the door, opens it, steps across
	the threshold, reaches back to switch off the light. GO TO
	BLACK.
	
	                          THE END

     INT.  MIAMI AIRPORT, TERMINAL -- DAY

     Amongst the weary tourist families and solitary businessmen
     sits TOM WELLES, middle-aged, hair neat, suit crisp and
     gray.  He's eating crackers from a cellophane package,
     sipping soda from a paper cup, watching an ARRIVAL GATE.

     AT THE GATE

     PASSENGERS arrive: the paunchy, graying men of First Class
     leading the pack, except for a handsome YOUNG REPUBLICAN
     poster boy hurrying along.

     ACROSS THE TERMINAL

     Welles gets up and FOLLOWS...

     EXT.  MIAMI AIRPORT, CURBSIDE -- DAY

     Welles comes outside, squinting in the sun, moving down the
     sidewalk, looking back over his shoulder...

     The Young Republican is lead to a waiting LIMO by a DRIVER.

     Welles moves to the nearby TAXI STAND...

     INT.  TAXI -- DAY

     Welles gets in, turning in his seat to watch behind.

                             CAB DRIVER
               Where to?

     Welles keeps watching, sees the limo pull away and pass.

                             WELLES
               Follow that limousine.  Don't get
               too close, don't let it get too far
               away.  Just keep with it.

                             CAB DRIVER
               You kidding?

                             WELLES
               Nope.

     The cab set in motion.  Welles takes out cigarettes,
     lighting one, takes out a small NOTEPAD and makes notations.

                             CAB DRIVER
               Uh, listen... you're not supposed to
               be smoking in here.  I'm sorry,
               that's company policy...

                             WELLES
               How about this... every cigarette I
               smoke, I give you five dollars?

                             CAB DRIVER
               Okay... okay, yeah, that'd be good...


     EXT.  MIAMI BEACH, "GOLD COAST" -- DAY

     In front of an Art Deco hotel, the driver opens the
     limousine door and the Young Republican steps out. 

     ACROSS THE STREET 

     Welles watches from inside the double-parked taxicab. 


     EXT.  MIAMI BEACH MOTOR LODGE -- DAY 

     Not exactly four-star.  "<b>AD LT MOVIES EVERY ROOM.</b>" 

     INT.  MIAMI BEACH MOTOR LODGE -- DAY

     Welles is asleep on the bed, full dressed, hands folded
     across his stomach, snoring lightly, sweaty. 

     INT.  MIAMI BEACH MOTOR LODGE, RESTAURANT -- DAY 

     Welles sits alone at the bar, eating a sandwich, bored.  He
     watches some fuzzy ESPN on the t.v., looks at his watch. 

     EXT.  MIAMI BEACH MOTOR LODGE -- DAY 

     Welles walks across the parking lot, gets into his RENTAL
     CAR, starts it and drives away. 


     EXT.  MIAMI BEACH DISCOTHEQUE -- NIGHT 

     Young Republican and a GAUDY WOMAN exit the disco, MUSIC
     THROBBING out from the doors behind them.  They join hands,
     drunk, heading to the street, looking for their limo. 

     DOWN THE STREET

     Welles is seated in his parked rental car, raises a CAMERA
     with TELEPHOTO LENS: whir, CLICK, whir, CLICK, whir, CLICK...
     Welles lowers the camera, letting out a yawn. 


     INT.  AIRPLANE, COACH -- NIGHT 

     The familiar DRONE of flight.  Welles is shoehorned into his
     aisle seat, using tiny utensils to eat his tiny meal.

     An OLDER WOMAN arrives in the aisle.  Welles picks up his
     tray, closes his tray table, unbuckling his seatbelt,
     struggling to get up... finally successful, balancing his
     tray, letting the woman in to the window seat. 

                             OLDER WOMAN 
                 Thank you. 

     Welles nods, forcing a smile, sitting back down.  He returns
     to toiling over his miniature supper. 


     EXT.  HARRISBURG INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT -- NIGHT 

     Welles' AIRPLANE ROARS down with a SCREECH, landing lights
     gleaming.  The airport is small, relatively isolated.

     TITLE:      <b>Harrisburg, Pennsylvania</b>

     INT.  HARRISBURG INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT -- NIGHT

     Passengers arrive.  Welles is with them, searching the few
     PEOPLE waiting in the terminal hallway.  Welles smiles...

     Welles' wife, AMY, smiles when she sees him.  She's plain
     and pretty, holding one hand on a BABY STROLLER beside her.
     Welles comes to her, embracing her, appreciating her.

                             AMY
                 Welcome home.

                             WELLES
                 Do you know how much I missed you?

     They kiss, but Amy pulls away, sniffs him.

                             AMY 
                 What's this... have you been
                 smoking... ? 

                             WELLES 
                 Smoking?  I'm not smoking. 

                             AMY 
                 Your clothing reeks of it. 

                             WELLES 
                 You know, Amy, I've been sitting
                 around in bars and everywhere
                 following this guy... I mean, is
                 this what I get first thing?  Before
                 you even "hello," you accuse me... ?

                             AMY 
                 I'm not accusing you... 

                             WELLES 
                 Well, I'm not smoking, okay? 

                             AMY 
                 Okay, I believe you. 

                             WELLES 
                 We've been all through that.  I've
                 been on my best behavior.

     Welles bends to the stroller, picks up his infant daughter,
     CINDY, and hoists her in the air, overjoyed. 

                             WELLES 
                 Hello, pumpkin-head, did you miss
                 me?  I sure missed you... 

     He kisses the happy child, holding her in one arm. 

                             WELLES 
                 Let's get my bags and get the hell
                 out of here. 

     Welles pulls Amy close and kisses her again, leads the way.
     Amy follows, pushing the stroller. 

                             AMY 
                 How's the detective business?

                             WELLES 
                 Business was fine.  I'll tell you
                 what, you couldn't pay me enough to
                 live down there. 

                             AMY 
                 You better not be smoking, that's
                 all I can say. 

                             WELLES 
                 Honey, I'm not, please... 

     Amy takes Welles hand, smiling at him. 


     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles and Amy make love in the darkness.  Standard,
     missionary position sex, little passion.  They slow to a
     finish, uneventfully, holding each other.  Their breathing
     quiets.  Their daughter CINDY can be HEARD CRYING elsewhere.

     Welles kisses his wife again, rolls off of her and sits on
     the edge of the bed.  Amy covers herself. 

                             AMY
                 I love you.

                             WELLES
                 I love you. 

     He looks towards her in the dark.  He gets up, gets a towel
     from the bathroom and wraps it around him. 

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BABY'S ROOM -- NIGHT 

     Cindy's crying.  Welles enters, goes to lean into the crib.

                             WELLES 
                 What's all the trouble, Cinderella?
                 What are you crying about, huh? 

     He lifts and cradles Cindy, comforting her. 


     EXT.  HARRISBURG CITYSCAPE -- ESTABLISHING --DAY 

     A small city of moderate architecture facing the Susquehanna.

     INT.  OFFICE -- DAY 

     An old money office with windows over the river.  A well-to-
     do POLITICIAN looks unhappily through PHOTOS on his desk.
     Welles sits by the Pennsylvania state flag, watching.

     PHOTOS show the Young Republican and Gaudy Woman in Miami:
     leaving the Art Deco hotel, the Discotheque, a restaurant...

                             WELLES 
                 Your son-in-law dealt with the dry
                 cleaning franchise during the day,
                 saw that woman every night. 
                       (clears his throat) 
                 The specifics are in the report, and
                 information about the woman.  It's
                 unpleasant, I know.  I apologize... 

                             POLITICIAN 
                 None too discreet, is he? 

                             WELLES 
                 No, sir, he is not. 

                             POLITICIAN 
                 He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn
                 my daughter, but what can you do? 

     The politician shakes his head in disgust.  Welles rises. 

                             WELLES 
                 The um... you'll find my invoice in
                 the envelope. If that's all...

                             POLITICIAN 
                 Yes, Mister Welles, thank you. 

                             WELLES 
                 Certainly, Senator.  If I can ever
                 be of further assistance.

     Welles leaves, glances back, shuts the door. 

     EXT.  HARRISBURG STREETS -- DAY 

     Welles drives his plain Ford past the CAPITAL BUILDING. 

     EXT.  HARRISBURG, BRIDGE -- DAY 

     Welles' car crosses the Susquehanna, leaving the city. 

     EXT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BACKYARD -- DAY 

     Sunny day.  Welles wears tan khakis, T-shirt and fishing
     cap, mowing his lawn with his ROARING lawnmower.  Welles'
     yard is modest, surrounding his modest split level suburban
     one in a neighborhood of similar homes and similar yards.

     Welles turns the lawnmower, stopping to mop his brow.  One
     of his neighbors is repainting a back porch.  The neighbor
     waves.  Welles waves, resumes mowing. 


     INT.  BOWLING ALLEY -- NIGHT

     MUSIC'S LOUD.  League Night.  Every lane full.  Welles is
     with his team in BOWLING SHIRTS.  Welles hoists his ball,
     preparing to bowl.  He takes three steps, releases...

     Down the lane, PINS SCATTER.  One pin remains standing.

     Welles balls up his fists and curses, walks back towards his
     rowdy, mocking teammates.  He shouts back at them, laughing,
     grabbing his beer and drinking, waiting at the ball return. 

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT 

     Dinner.  Welles and Amy eat at the kitchen table with Cindy
     in a high chair.  Amy feeds Cindy between bites.  Welles is
     still in his league shirt. 

                             AMY 
                 You think you'll have time for the
                 water heater this weekend?

                             WELLES 
                 Sure.  I'll call the guy. 

                             AMY 
                 You're not using the same guy who
                 tried to fix it? 

                             WELLES 
                 I'm not using him again for
                 anything.  He was worthless. 
                       (eating)
                 You have bridge here Saturday? 

                             AMY 
                 Betty's out of town so we're playing
                 next week. 

     Welles nods, eating.  He watches Amy feed Cindy.  The PHONE
     starts RINGING.  Welles goes to answer it. 

                             WELLES 
                       (into PHONE) 
                 Hello.  Yes... could you hold on a
                 minute...?

     Welles hands the phone to Amy, pats Cindy's head as he heads
     downstairs, through the LIVING ROOM... 

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, OFFICE -- NIGHT

     Welles enters his well kept OFFICE, turns on a light at the
     desk.  The room is filled with FILE CABINETS and shelves of
     BOOKS, hundreds of PHONE BOOKS and a COPY MACHINE.  Welles
     picks up the phone and cups the receiver. 

                             WELLES 
                       (shouts upstairs)
                 Okay, I've got it.
                       (into phone)
                 Hello... sorry, I was switching
                 phones.  It's a pleasure to make
                 your acquaintance, Mrs. Christian.
                       (listens)
                 Yes.  Yes, I understand... tomorrow
                 evening should be fine...

     Welles listens, clears space on his desk, taking notes. 


     EXT.  CHRISTIAN COMPOUND -- DUSK 

     A huge OLD WORLD MANSION is situated at the center of acres
     of Pennsylvania forest and vast gardens.  Welles' car heads
     down a long tree lined drive, to the dark mansion. 

     INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, HALLWAY -- NIGHT 

     Welles follows a BUTLER down a long hall. 

     INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, LIBRARY -- NIGHT 

     The butler shows Welles in, shuts the door.
     Towering SHELVES of BOOKS are serviced by ladders.  Far
     across the room, an old, sad woman, MRS. CHRISTIAN, sits
     waiting with a tall, thin, sinister ghoul of a LAWYER.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Mister Welles. You're very prompt.   

                             WELLES 
                 I try to be.

     Welles crosses towards them. It takes a while. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 I appreciate your coming on such
                 short notice. 

     Mrs. Christian holds out her hand and Welles takes it. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                 This is Mister Longdale, my late
                 husband's attorney. 

     Welles shakes Longdale's limp hand, looking him over. 

                             WELLES 
                 Uh huh, pleasure. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Apparently Mr. Longdale has
                 something he feels he simply must
                 say before you and I speak.

                             LONGDALE 
                 Yes, I do have something to say.  I
                 insisted on being here as soon as I
                 heard Mrs. Christian contacted you. 

                             WELLES 
                 I'm listening. 

                             LONGDALE 
                 As Mr. Christian's attorney and one
                 of the executors of his estate, it
                 concerns me that a meeting of this
                 sort should take place without my
                 being asked to attend. 

                             WELLES
                 Of what sort? 

                             LONGDALE
                 You are a private investigator? 

                             WELLES 
                 That's right. 

                             LONGDALE 
                 Well, whatever reasons Mrs.
                 Christian has for engaging the
                 services of a private investigator,
                 I should certainly be a party to.
                 But, since she feels differently, I
                 can only go on the record as having
                 expressed my adamant disapproval. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Yes, how theatrical.  So you've gone
                 on the record, and now perhaps you
                 should just be gone. 

     Longdale's irritated, but has no choice.  He walks away. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Have a pleasant evening. 
                       (to Welles) 
                 Will you have tea, Mister Welles? 

                             WELLES
                 Thank you. 

     Mrs. Christian begins pouring tea from the service on a
     table.  Welles watches Longdale exit. 

                             WELLES 
                 He's odd.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 He's a lawyer.
                       (offers tea)
                 Please, sit, here...

     Welles accepts a dainty tea cup and saucer, taking a seat.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 I've spoken to friends of mine and
                 my husband's, in Harrisburg, in
                 Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about
                 you.  I must say you have friends in
                 influential places. 

                             WELLES
                 I've been privileged to provide
                 services for people I admire.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 You are highly recommended.  Praised
                 for your discretion... your strict
                 adherence to confidentiality. 

     Welles nods, sipping tea. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 As you know, my husband passed away
                 recently.  Two weeks ago now.

                             WELLES 
                 My condolences. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 His passing has left me with...
                 something of a dilemma.  A terrible,
                 terrible dilemma. 

                             WELLES 
                 I'll do whatever I can to help. 

     Mrs. Christian studies Welles.

     INT. CHRISTIAN HOUSE, MR CHRISTIAN'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

     Mrs. Christian and Welles enter.  This office has been lived
     in for a lifetime.  Giant DESK.  AMERICAN FLAG.  Walls
     covered in old b+w PHOTOGRAPHS and ACHIEVEMENTS. A large,
     baked enamel sign nailed up, "<b>CHRISTIAN STEEL.</b>" 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 His inner sanctum. 

     Welles looks up at the OIL PAINTING over the fireplace: MR.
     CHRISTIAN, a powerful, old man, posed with a dark, teeming,
     industrial landscape behind him. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Not many people have been inside
                 this room. 

     Welles examines PHOTOS of Mr. Christian visiting various
     STEEL PLANTS, COAL MINES and ground-breaking ceremonies,
     shaking hands with WORKMEN, with POLITICIANS. 


                             WELLES 
                 Pittsburgh? 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Mostly.  That's where he started his
                 empire building.
                       (looks up at portrait)
                 He was a good man.  Notorious as an
                 eccentric, but that was something he
                 cultivated.  He <u>wanted</u> to be
                 legendary.

                             WELLES 
                 He succeeded. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 We were married forty-five years.
                 Hard even for me to imagine.  We had
                 our troubles.  There were plenty of
                 places for him to be other than
                 here, but he was always loyal to me,
                 and I to him.  I loved him deeply.

     Welles waits. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles? 

                             WELLES 
                 I wear a gun when I can tell a
                 client expects me to.  Other than
                 that, there's never any reason. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Just curious. 

     Mrs. Christian crosses to take down a PICTURE, revealing a
     WALL SAFE.  The safe is ajar, burnt and scarred, broken into.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 My husband was the only one with the
                 combination to this safe.  I knew
                 about it, but as far as I was
                 concerned it was none of my
                 business.  Not till now, that is. 

                             WELLES 
                 You hired someone to open it.  I'll
                 bet the lawyer loved that.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 There was nothing he could do.  My
                 husband left everything to me.
                       (looks at safe)
                 I prevented anyone from seeing the
                 contents.  I felt these were my
                 husband's private things.  I
                 didn't... I didn't realize... 

                             WELLES 
                 Do you want to tell me what you
                 found? 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Cash, stock certificates, and this...

     She takes something from her pocket, puts it on the desk: a
     plastic bag containing a short 8MM FILM on a plastic reel.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 It's a film... of a girl being
                 murdered. 

                             WELLES 
                 I'm afraid I don't... 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 This is a movie showing a girl being
                 murdered.  She's sitting on a bed,
                 and a man rapes her... and he begins
                 to cut her with a knife...
                       (pause)
                 I only watched what I could.

     Welles picks up the film, looks at it. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 I didn't know what to think.  I
                 can't tell you how horrible it's
                 been, to know this belonged to my
                 husband.  To know that he watched
                 this... this atrocity.  But, I can't
                 go to the police...

                             WELLES
                 Mrs. Christian... please, will you
                 sit down a moment? 
                       (leads her to a chair) 
                 I want you to listen carefully.
                 What you're talking about is a
                 "snuff film."  But, from what I
                 know, snuff films are a kind of...
                 urban myth.  Like, red light
                 district folklore.  There's no such
                 thing, I can assure you. 

     Mrs. Christian shakes her head. 

                             WELLES 
                 Please, believe me.  This is
                 probably a stag film.  Simulated
                 rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might
                 seem real, but there are ways of
                 making it look realistic... fake
                 blood and special effects...

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 No. 

                             WELLES 
                 If you were to study it you'd see
                 the camera cutting away... you'd see
                 the tricks they can play...

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 I'm telling you it's not that. 

                             WELLES 
                 I'm sure it is. 
                       (smiles) 
                 It's probably something your husband
                 was given as a bad joke.  More than
                 likely he never even watched it. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Will you watch it and see for
                 yourself? 

                             WELLES 
                 Of course.  But, I'm certain it's
                 nothing to worry about. 


     INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, DINING ROOM -- NIGHT 

     An 8MM PROJECTOR faces a wall.  Welles looks back to Mrs.
     Christian in the doorway.  Mrs. Christian leaves, shuts the
     door.  Darkness.  Welles turns on the projector and sits.
     The PROJECTOR CLATTERS, shooting bright images...

     ON THE WALL: FLASH FRAMES, over exposure, then... the grainy
     FILM is HAND HELD, constantly in motion, showing a skinny
     GIRL, 16 or 17, in a negligee, sitting on a bed in a
     nondescript room with little furniture.  Looks like a hotel
     room.  We only ever see three walls.  The once beautiful
     girl looks worn, drugged, dark circles under her eyes,
     staring blankly.  The CAMERA'S tungsten SPOTLIGHT casts
     long, shifting shadows as the camera moves, but the girl
     still stares oblivious.  The bed is wrapped in PLASTIC and
     DUCT TAPE.  The floor is covered by PLASTIC SHEETING...

     Welles watches, crossing his arms, already uncomfortable.

     ON THE WALL: a door opens behind the girl, looks like a
     bathroom, and a MASKED MAN enters.

     The Masked Man wears a garish, Mexican WRESTLING MASK with
     eye holes and a mouth.  The mask covers his entire head.
     He's naked except for red shorts, his body scrawny, oiled,
     pale.  The man goes to stand in front of the girl.  He seems
     to be saying something to her, but the film is silent and
     the ONLY SOUND is the PROJECTOR'S LOUD sprocket hole
     CLATTER.  It's all one long take.  The CAMERA MOVES to favor
     the girl...

     Welles sits straight in his chair, wary.

     ON THE WALL: Masked Man raises his open hand and SLAPS the
     girl, knocking her back on the bed...

     Welles grimaces.

     ON THE WALL: Masked Man pulls the girl back to a seated
     position.  The girl's like a rag doll, face reddened, eyes
     closed, but she remains upright.  Masked Man uses his thumbs
     to open her unseeing eyes.  He touches her mouth with his
     fingers, presses his lips to hers.  Then, Masked Man backs
     away, leaving frame, till the CAMERA MOVES to find Masked
     Man standing at a table with THREE large BOWIE KNIFES laid
     out.  Masked Man runs his fingers over the blades...

     Welles rises slowly, still watching.

     ON THE WALL: Masked Man selects a huge Bowie knife and moves
     back towards the girl...

     Welles crosses his arms tight, disbelieving, fearful.
     <u>WE WILL NEVER SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IN THE FILM</u>, but Welles
     does.  In the flickering, reflected light, Welles backs
     involuntarily away from the horrible images, holding his
     fist to his mouth, breathing hard.

     Welles keeps backing away, till he's backed against a wall.
     The PROJECTOR'S CLATTERING.  Welles is sickened, sweating,
     still watching, till he finally shuts his eyes.

     INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, ADJOINING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Silence.  Mrs. Christian sits waiting, troubled.
     The door to the dining room opens and Welles enters from the
     dark, visibly shaken.  Mrs. Christian watches him, her
     sorrow now shared.

                             WELLES
                 You... you need to go to the police. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 I told you I can't, not yet. 

                             WELLES
                 You don't have any other choice. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                       (stands, shakes her head) 
                 No.  For me to live with the ruin of
                 my husband's name, I need know that
                 whoever did this will be punished.
                 If you can find them, I will take
                 their names to the police.  I'll say
                 my husband confessed on his death
                 bed. I'll say I didn't have courage
                 to come forward at first...

                             WELLES 
                 It won't work like that.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Any evidence you collect can be
                 given to the police later,
                 anonymously.  I've thought about it
                 and there's no other way.  If you
                 can't find them... if the only thing
                 that comes from this film is that
                 this is all my husband will be
                 remembered for, well I can't let
                 that happen.  I'm telling you I
                 won't.  If there's no chance that
                 poor girl's memory can be served,
                 then I'll just have to spend my last
                 days trying to forget her. 

     Welles sits, rests his head in his hands. 

                             WELLES 
                 I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate
                 investigations...

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 You've found missing persons before. 

                             WELLES 
                 Nothing remotely like this. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 I know what I'm asking.  Your
                 compensation will be appropriate to
                 the risk.  You'll need cash to buy
                 information, and I'll provide it.
                       (pause)
                 I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.
                       (pause)
                 You saw what he did to her.

     Welles stands, torn apart and uncertain, looks back to the
     dining room where the projector sits idle.


     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BABY'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Cindy is sound asleep in her crib.
     Welles is seated near, staring at his sleeping child.

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles digs in piles of SHOEBOXES and BOOKS on the floor of
     his cluttered closet, finds what he wants: a LOCK BOX.

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Welles twists the lock box dial's combination, opens the box
     to reveal his GUN, HOLSTER and CLEANING SUPPLIES.  Welles
     takes out the gun, cleaning it.  Amy watches.

                             WELLES 
                 This is the mortgage.  This is
                 Cindy's college money. 

                             AMY
                 I understand.

                             WELLES 
                 Sometimes you can't know what I'm
                 doing.  It's better that way.

                             AMY
                 I know.

                             WELLES 
                 It's a missing persons case... a
                 long shot.  I'll give it two months,
                 two months at most, then I'll be
                 back.  We'll take a vacation.

                             AMY
                 Why the gun? 

                             WELLES 
                 I'm not gonna need it.  I won't even
                 wear it.  It's a precaution.
                       (cleaning gun)
                 Don't worry about me.


     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, OFFICE -- NIGHT

     Welles looks through one file cabinet.  He pulls out a FILE.
     It contains all sorts of POLICE ARTIST SKETCHES.  Welles
     finds one of a TEENAGE GIRL with dark hair, looks at it.

     Welles positions the sketch on his COPY MACHINE, hits copy.

     EXT.  WELLES' HOUSE, DRIVEWAY -- MORNING

     Welles loads BOXES and a SUITCASE into his car's back seat.

     Welles puts the lock box in the car's trunk, in a hiding
     place beside the spare tire.  He places a brown BRIEFCASE on
     top, covers them both with carpet.  He closes the trunk.

     EXT.  PENNSYLVANIA TURNPIKE -- MORNING 

     Little traffic.  Welles' Ford races down the highway.


     EXT.  CLEVELAND CITYSCAPE -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY

     City skyline, overcast.  Looks like rain.

     TITLE:       <b>Cleveland, Ohio</b>

     EXT.  CLEVELAND STREETS -- DAY

     Welles' car moves slowly in a not-so-great neighborhood.
     Welles leans forward, peering through the windshield...

     An APARTMENT BUILDING'S crooked SIGN lists "<b>WEEKLY RATES.</b>"

     INT.  WELLES' ROOM, CLEVELAND -- DAY

     Dingy room.  Welles locks the door, puts the chain on. His
     suitcase and boxes are on the bed.  He begins unpacking,
     taking a PHOTO ENLARGER from one box and an 8MM PROJECTOR.

     INT.  WELLES' ROOM, BATHROOM -- DAY

     The developer's on the toilet.  DEVELOPING PANS are on the
     floor, developer bath, stop bath and fixing bath, with
     BOTTLES of CHEMICALS and packages of PHOTO PAPER.  Welles
     uses tape and ALUMINUM FOIL to black-out a window.

     INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- DAY

     Pizza box on the bedside table.  Welles' suits hang in the
     closet.  Welles sits facing a small REEL TO REEL on a desk.
     He wears white gloves, handles the 8MM FILM, careful to hold
     it by the edges, holding it up to the light, squinting.

     Welles puts in a magnifying EYEPIECE, leaning close...

     WELLES' P.O.V. THROUGH MAGNIFYING LENS: studying the first
     few inches of exposed film, coming upon TINY LETTERS printed
     just below the sprocket holes: "<b>SUPRAlux 544.</b>"
 
     INT.  WELLES' ROOM, BATHROOM -- DAY

     RED BULB in the light socket.  Welles threads the 8MM FILM
     into his enlarger, still in white gloves.

     He flicks the enlarger on, projecting a sideways IMAGE down
     onto the enlarger's baseboard, FOCUSING... it's the girl
     sitting on the bed, early in the snuff film.

     Welles makes an adjustment to the enlarger's lens; framing
     tighter on the girl's face, REFOCUSING.

     INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles comes out of the makeshift darkroom, holding a PHOTO
     of the girl.  He props the photo up on a dresser, stands
     looking at it.  Sad girl, staring forward.

     Welles goes to pick up his CELLULAR PHONE, dials.

                             WELLES 
                       (into phone) 
                 Hello, honey, it's me.
                       (listens)
                 I'm fine, how are you?

     Welles listens.  He turns to look at the girl's photo.

                                              FADE TO BLACK:

     EXT.  OFFICE BUILDING, MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE -- DAY

     Nondescript.  "<b>U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons.</b>"

     INT.  MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, OFFICES -- DAY 

     Small.  Cubicles.  Employees work phones and computers.
     BULLETIN BOARDS are covered in FAMILY PHOTOS, Polaroids and
     familiar "HAVE YOU SEEN ME?" missing person/children POSTERS.

     IN ONE CUBICLE, Welles opens his billfold, shows his
     identification: a laminated "<b>LICENSED INVESTIGATOR,</b>
     <b>Commonwealth of Pennsylvania</b>", with WELLES' PHOTO...

     The DIRECTOR of the center, a tired looking official in
     bifocals, studies the card.  Welles sits.

                             DIRECTOR 
                 What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?

                             WELLES 
                 Call me Tom.

                             DIRECTOR 
                 Alright, Tom.

                             WELLES
                 What I'd like, very simply, is
                 access to your archive.  And, now I
                 understand this isn't something you
                 normally do for private citizens...

                             DIRECTOR 
                 There are reasons for the way we do
                 things here.

                             WELLES 
                 Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by
                 whatever decision you make, but I'd
                 appreciate if you'll hear me out... 

     The director sits back in his chair.

                             WELLES 
                 Few days ago, I was contacted by a
                 couple living in Philadelphia, a
                 doctor and his wife.  What happened
                 was they picked up a young girl
                 hitchhiking off 81, which heads into
                 Philadelphia, started up a
                 conversation with this girl, she
                 looked homeless, seemed about
                 eighteen maybe.  They convinced her
                 to let them buy her a meal in the
                 city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have
                 much to say, but they got a sense
                 she's a runaway, so all through
                 dinner the doctor's working on her,
                 trying to convince her that at the
                 very least she should pick up a
                 telephone.  Not surprisingly, she
                 ate her food, excused herself...
                       (snaps fingers)
                 That's the last they saw her.  The
                 reason they came to me for help, the
                 reason I'm coming to you, is we had
                 a friend of mine in the department
                 work up a sketch...
                       (shows the POLICE ARTIST
                        SKETCH he photocopied)
                 They want to see if I can I.D. this
                 girl, somehow pass along a message
                 to let the parents know the kid's
                 alive, doing alright.

                             DIRECTOR 
                 Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or
                 N.C.M.E.C.? 

                             WELLES 
                 I figured you share information. 

                             DIRECTOR 
                 We do. 

                             WELLES 
                 For whatever reasons I thought you
                 might be more receptive.

                             DIRECTOR 
                 Why don't they come to me? 

                             WELLES 
                 This doctor and wife, they're nice
                 people, but they don't want to get
                 too involved.  They're not trying to
                 have the parents come looking for
                 the girl either. 
                 You and I both know sometimes, not
                 often, but sometimes there's real
                 reasons why a kid'll run. 
                 Molestation, whatever.  Besides
                 that, the girl's probably eighteen,
                 so she's legal.

                             DIRECTOR 
                 I'm not so sure about this. 

                             WELLES 
                 They're putting themselves in place
                 of this kid's parents and thinking
                 they'd want to hear their girl's
                 okay, even if that's all they hear. 

                             DIRECTOR
                 I can give you my card, if your
                 clients want to call me... 

     Welles accepts a CARD, disappointed.

                             WELLES 
                 They were pretty clear they didn't
                 want this coming back on them.

                             DIRECTOR 
                 Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry. 

     Welles looks at the director, stands, hangs his head.

                             WELLES 
                 Who knows... maybe she's already
                 given her parents a call, right?

     Welles leaves. 

     EXT.  OFFICE BUILDING, MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE -- DAY

     Welles comes out the front doors, pissed.

                             WELLES 
                 Fuck.

     He tears the card in half and drops it as he heads for his
     car.  After a moment, the director comes out after him...

                             DIRECTOR 
                 Excuse me... Tom, hold on...

     Welles looks back, walks back, glances down...
     makes sure he stands on the torn card, hiding it underfoot.

                             DIRECTOR
                 Listen, maybe I can help after all.
                 Why don't you come on back in...
                 we'll see what we can do. 

     INT.  MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY

     Director leads Welles into this RESEARCH ROOM, a small
     library with long tables, old COMPUTERS, lots of FILE
     CABINETS and CARD CATALOGS.  Secretaries tend to the files.

                             DIRECTOR 
                 This is it.  It's not much. 
                       (points at computers) 
                 We've got less than five percent on
                 computer and we lose that funding in
                 December.  I'll have someone show it
                 to you anyway.  Other than that, I'm
                 afraid it's the wet thumb method.

     Welles looks to the many, many file drawers. 

                             DIRECTOR 
                 Files are mostly by state and year
                 of disappearance.  We try to keep
                 the children and adults separate.
                 No eating or smoking in here, but
                 there's a coffee machine in the hall.

                             WELLES 
                 Any good?

                             DIRECTOR
                 It's horrible, but it'll be your
                 best friend after a few days.  I
                 hope you realize what kind of long
                 shot you're chasing after. 

                             WELLES
                 You're gonna be seeing a lot of me.
                 You're sure you don't mind?

                             DIRECTOR 
                 It's good what you're doing.

     The director puts out his hand.  Welles looks, shakes.


     INT.  MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     ON A COMPUTER SCREEN: files open and close -- PICTURE after
     PICTURE of a MISSING CHILDREN, mostly teenagers, each with
     physical description, age, date of disappearance, etc.  Lost
     souls, although these are posed portraits, high school
     yearbook photos and vacation photos, so the children are
     mostly smiling, happy and healthy. But, all "<b>MISSING.</b>"

     Welles works the computer keyboard and mouse...

     ON THE SCREEN: the FACES of TEENAGERS, boys and girls, one
     after the other, MISSING... MISSING... MISSING...


     INT.  CLEVELAND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     Welles searches the SHELVES of the LIBRARY.  He begins
     taking down various books...

     "<b>Motion Picture Photography.</b>"  "<b>Film Stocks and Physical
     Characteristics.</b>"  "<b>Super 8 Filmmaking.</b>"

     INT.  CLEVELAND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- LATER -- MONTAGE

     In Welles' notepad: "<b>SUPRAlux 544.</b>"
     Welles sits paging through technical photography books. 


     INT. WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

     Welles has the 8MM FILM threaded through the projector.  He
     turns the CLATTERING projector on and sits, watching.

     ON THE WALL: FLASH FRAMES, then... the skinny GIRL in a
     negligee, sitting on the bed.  The CAMERA'S SPOTLIGHT casts
     long shadows.  The girl stares, oblivious...

     ON THE WALL: a door opens behind the girl, looks like a
     bathroom, and the MASKED MAN enters, wearing the ghastly
     WRESTLING MASK.  The man goes to stand in front of the
     girl.  He seems to be saying something.  The FILM halts.

     Welles sits forward, hand on the projector.  He's seen
     something.  He PLAYS the FILM in REVERSE...

     ON THE WALL: the Masked Man walks backwards, away from the
     girl, backwards into the bathroom, door shutting...

     Welles stops the projector, not taking his eyes from the
     image.  He ADVANCES the film FRAME BY FRAME...

     FRAME BY FRAME... as the bathroom door opens, and the Masked
     Man enters... FRAME BY FRAME... as the Masked Man moves
     forward... door closing behind him... STOP...

     FREEZE FRAME: a THIRD MAN is reflected in the bathroom
     mirror.  Grainy and blurred, but he's in the room with the
     girl, standing there, captured in the mirror in this one
     brief instant just before the bathroom door closes.

     Welles walks to take a closer look, studying the almost
     ethereal image of the Third Man.


     EXT.  CLEVELAND STREET CORNER -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     Welles is in a PHONE BOOTH, feeds many quarters into the
     phone, waiting, looking at his notepad. 

                             WELLES
                       (into PHONE) 
                 Hello, Mrs. Christian?  Tom Welles.
                 Here's where we stand.  I checked
                 the film stock and it's called Supra-
                 lux 544.  The company that made that
                 stock discontinued it in '92...
                       (listens)
                 Yeah, about five or six years ago.
                 Anyway, do what you can to dig up
                 your husband's old financial
                 records, look for anything out of
                 the ordinary...

     INT.  MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     Welles is back at the computer, alone, drinking coffee.
     ON THE COMPUTER: endless PHOTOS of MISSING CHILDREN.
     The <u>PHONE CALL CONTINUES in VOICE OVER</u>:

                             WELLES (V.O., cont)
                 Nobody really uses eight millimeter
                 film anymore, so we can assume there
                 are reasons our guys did.  First,
                 they could develop it themselves if
                 they had any sort of expertise.
                 Obviously, this isn't the kind of
                 movie you can just drop off at the
                 one-hour photo...

     INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

     Welles just stands, staring at the PHOTO of the GIRL.

                             WELLES (V.O., cont)
                 Second, the film that went through
                 the camera is what we've got.
                 There's no negative.  Unlike video,
                 it wasn't meant to be duplicated.
                 No reason for them to risk having
                 more than one copy of their murder
                 floating around...

     INT.  CLEVELAND BAR -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

     Local bar.  Welles sits drinking with the archive's
     director, talking, smiling at something the director said.

                             WELLES (V.O., cont)
                 There don't seen to be many
                 fingerprints on the film itself, but
                 I'm going to have to be careful to
                 leave them intact...

     INT.  MISSING PERSON ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     Welles is tired, unshaven.  He's moved on to the physical
     files, at one table, looking through HUNDREDS of MISSING
     PERSON BULLETINS.  Secretaries tend to other files. 

                             WELLES (V.O., cont)
                 It's okay for yours and your
                 husbands fingerprints to be on the
                 film, but you'll have to use me as
                 a middleman if you go to the police.
                 That way I don't have to explain why
                 my prints are on it...

     INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     Welles sits with the PROJECTOR ON, watching the film again.

                             WELLES (V.O., cont)
                 There were three men.  Two are
                 obvious; the man in the mask and the
                 man running the camera, but I caught
                 a glimpse of a third man in a
                 mirror.  It's nothing that can be
                 used for identification, but he was
                 there, watching...

     ON THE WALL: Masked Man touches the girl's mouth, presses
     his lips to hers.  Masked Man backs away, leaving frame,
     till the CAMERA MOVES to find Masked Man standing at a table
     with THREE large BOWIE KNIFES laid out...

     Welles notices something, puts the projector on FREEZE FRAME.

                             WELLES (V.O., cont)
                 So, there were three.  They would
                 have kept it small, wouldn't have
                 let anyone in on it they didn't have
                 to.  That's all for now... except,
                 I feel I should tell you... with
                 this looking like it happened at
                 least five or six years ago...

     Welles walks to the frozen IMAGE on the wall.  It shows the
     Masked Man's hands in frame, fingering the blades.

                             WELLES (V.O., cont)
                 Well, it's not very likely we'll
                 ever find out who this girl was. 
                       (listens) 
                 I will, I'll keep trying. Goodbye.

     V.O. PHONE CALL ends with the SOUND of the PHONE HANGING UP.

     ON THE WALL: there's a DARK SPOT on Masked Man's hand, on
     the arch between his index finger and thumb.  Grainy and
     hard to make out, but looks like a small TATTOO.

     INT.  WELLES ROOM, BATHROOM -- NIGHT -- END MONTAGE

     Welles has the 8MM FILM threaded into his photo enlarger,
     projecting the IMAGE we just saw down onto the baseboard.

     He re-frames, CLOSER ON the masked Man's hand, REFOCUSING...
     the black spot is a little clearer, looks like a small STAR
     tattoo on the back of Masked Man's hand.

     INT.  MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY

     Welles sits hunched over the card catalog, still unshaven,
     drinking coffee, flipping through smaller PICTURES of
     MISSING CHILDREN in one drawer, one by one by one...

     Welles rolls his neck.  He looks to see the archive's
     director in the doorway.  The director nods, leaving.
     Welles gets back to it, stooped over the catalog.

                                              FADE TO BLACK:

     TITLE CARD:      <b>three weeks later</b>

     EXT.  OFFICE BUILDING, MISSING PERSON ARCHIVE -- DAY

     In the lot, Welles gets wearily from his car, smoking.  He
     tosses the cigarette, gets a Thermos off the front seat.

     INT.  MISSING PERSON ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY

     Welles pulls out a card catalog drawer labeled "<b>North
     Carolina 1992,</b>" flipping through picture cards.  The FACES
     of TEENAGERS: a happy BOY with blue eyes... a red headed
     GIRL with freckles... a ruddy faced BOY... a pretty GIRL
     with a ribbon in her hair... a black GIRL in a pink dress...
     a blonde haired BOY with curly hair...

     Welles furrows his brow.

     He backtracks to the pretty GIRL with the ribbon in her hair.

     Welles sits straight.  He reaches into his pocket, hands
     shaking a little, takes out and unfolds the PHOTO he printed
     of the girl from the snuff film.  It's her.

     Welles compares the two pictures.  She's prettier in the
     card catalog photo, but it's her.

     Welles can't believe it, looks around.  Secretaries at other
     files don't even know he's there.  Welles pulls out his
     notepad, scribbling down INFORMATION off the card...

     Writing the girl's name: "<b>Mary Anne Matthews.</b>"

     "<b>Search Continues for Local Teen.</b>"

     There's a PICTURE of the GIRL, Mary Anne Mathews; the same
     picture Welles found in the Missing Person Archive.

     Welles reads the article, writing on a LEGAL PAD.

     EXT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, FAYETTEVILLE SUBURB -- DAY

     A tree-lined street of poor, boxy homes.  Welles' car parks
     in front of one HOUSE with a neglected lawn.

     IN THE CAR

     Welles, clean shaven, picks a CLIPBOARD with a file folder
     and his legal pad on it, thumbs pages.  He drums his
     fingers, opens the glove compartment, pulls out the car's
     registration, other papers and "Jiffy-Lube" service reports,
     uses them to pad the file.

     Welles takes a BOTTLE of COLOGNE from his pocket.  He
     considers it, opens the bottle, applies cologne to his neck.

     EXT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, FRONT PORCH -- DAY

     Welles knocks, clipboard in hand.  A sad, middle-aged woman
     answers, MRS. MATHEWS, looking through the screen door.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Yes... ?

                             WELLES
                       (smiles)
                 Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's
                 Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed
                 investigator...

     Welles holds up his identification only long enough for Mrs.
     Mathews to see it looks official.

                             WELLES
                 I've been hired as an independent
                 contractor by the U.S. Resource
                 Center for Missing Persons as part
                 of an internal audit.  If you have
                 any time over the next few days, I'd
                 like to make an appointment to ask
                 some questions about the
                 disappearance of your daughter.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 I don't understand, who are... ?

                             WELLES
                 I'm sorry, let me explain, the
                 R.C.M.P. is a support organization
                 and archive, not unlike the Center
                 for Missing and Exploited Children
                 in Washington.  I'm sure you've
                 dealt with them before?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Yes, but... 

                             WELLES 
                 These volunteer organizations are
                 sort of interconnected, functioning
                 hand in hand with law enforcement.
                 The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review
                 their investigations...
                       (holds up clipboard)
                 ... fact-check their records, see if
                 there's anything they missed,
                 anything they should be doing
                 different.  I'm here for a few days,
                 before I head back up to Virginia.
                 These reports go to the Justice
                 Department eventually.  I spoke to
                 your F.B.I. contact a few days ago,
                 uh...

     Welles pretends to look for the name on a Jiffy Lube page...

                             WELLES 
                 What was the name... ? I've got it
                 here somewhere...

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Neil... Neil Cole.

                             WELLES
                       (pretends he found it)
                 Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call
                 and let you know to expect me.  He
                 didn't call?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 No.

                             WELLES
                       (looking on legal pad)
                 Well, I'm following up on your
                 daughter, Mary, height; five four,
                 weight; hundred ten pounds, brown
                 eyes, blonde hair.  Born April 24,
                 1976.  Missing June 11th, 1992.  A
                 runaway, that's how she's listed.
                 Is this information correct... ?

     Mrs. Mathews stares, nods.

                             WELLES
                 I'm sorry, I know this isn't easy.
                 Is there a more convenient time... ?
                       (looks at watch)
                 Can I buy you lunch, would that be
                 alright?

     Mrs. Mathews looks him up and down.


     EXT.  DAIRY QUEEN RESTAURANT -- DAY

     Welles and Mrs. Mathews eat at a PICNIC TABLE on the patio.

                             WELLES
                 It's very important you don't let
                 this raise your expectations.  It's
                 not going to effect any ongoing
                 efforts.  All I'm saying is, please
                 know, I'm not here to create any
                 false hope.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 They hired you.  You're like, a
                 private detective?

                             WELLES
                 That's exactly what I am.

     Mrs. Mathews chews, staring off into the distance.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 I didn't think there were private
                 detectives anymore, except on TV.

                             WELLES
                 You probably expect me to be wearing
                 a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking
                 whiskey, chasing women and getting
                 beaten up by guys with broken noses.
                 Want to know what it's really like? 
                 It's sitting in a car and staring at
                 a hotel window for three days
                 straight, pissing in a plastic
                 bottle, pardon me, because some guy
                 thinks his wife's cheating on him.
                 Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who
                 hired you, he has a hair-lip,
                 dandruff and crooked teeth, and you
                 could have told him the minute you
                 laid eyes on him his wife's
                 cheating, and you don't blame her.

     Mrs. Mathews smiles.

                             WELLES
                 It's refreshing to actually sit down
                 and meet someone face to face,
                 someone nice like you.

     Welles smiles.  Mrs. Mathews takes out a cigarette.  Welles
     lights her, joins her in smoking, refers to his clipboard.

                             WELLES
                 So, she didn't leave a note?  She
                 never gave any indication where she
                 might go, before she left?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 No.

                             WELLES
                 She just seemed... depressed... ?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 She didn't seem herself.  For months
                 there never was any way to get her
                 to talk about it.  One night we went
                 to bed... the next morning she was
                 gone.  She took some clothes.

                             WELLES
                 What was she running from?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 I don't know.

                             WELLES
                 If there's anything you feel
                 uncomfortable talking about, tell
                 me, but I have to ask.  Your
                 husband... he committed suicide?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Yes.

                             WELLES
                 September 4th, 1993.  About a year
                 after Mary disappeared.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 We were divorced by then.  Things
                 fell apart... he was living with a
                 friend...

                             WELLES
                 Why do you think he did it?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 It got to be too much for him.

                             WELLES
                 You have to forgive me, but in these
                 circumstances... with your
                 daughter...
                       (pause)
                 Were there any indications of... any
                 sort of abuse?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 There wasn't anything like that.
                 The police and the FBI people asked,
                 but there wasn't anything happened
                 like that, never.  My husband... his
                 heart broke when Mary left...

                             WELLES
                 I didn't mean to...

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 You try going through what we did.
                 Bob couldn't take it, that's all.
                 Christ, there's times when it still
                 seems like I can't either.

                             WELLES
                 I had to ask.  I apologize.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 No one knows what it's like.  You
                 can't even imagine how much it hurts. 

     Welles is miserable.  A few CUSTOMERS walk past, looking at
     Mrs. Mathews.  She tries not to notice then noticing.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 People remember me from the news.
                       (pause)
                 Can you drive me back now?

                             WELLES
                 Of course. 


     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, MARY'S ROOM -- DAY

     Mrs. Mathews enters.  Welles follows. 

     This was the girl's room, exactly as she left it -- POSTERS
     of ACTORS on the wall, many STUFFED ANIMALS on the pink
     sheets of the carefully made bed.  Perfectly preserved.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 This is her room.

     Welles looks around, uncomfortable.
     Shelves have PICTURES of MARY with female friends, a
     collection of CERAMIC FIGURINES of CLOWNS and ANIMALS.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 The police made a wreck of it, but
                 I put it back exactly how it was.
                 Just how she likes it.

     Welles takes a few steps into the room, looks down at a DESK
     where there are SIX brightly wrapped GIFTS.

                             MRS MATHEWS

                 Those are for her birthday.  One for
                 every year she's missed.  They'll be
                 waiting for her when she comes back. 

     Welles is nearly overwhelmed by sadness, struggling to hide
     it.  He backs to the door, looks at his watch...

                             WELLES
                 I... I shouldn't take anymore of
                 your time.  Maybe we can finish
                 tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Okay.

     EXT.  MATHEWS HOUSE -- DAY

     Welles escapes to his car, climbing in.  He starts it up...

     IN THE CAR

     Welles drives, tears welling up in his eyes.  He has to pull
     over and park, wiping his tears, fighting for composure.


     INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles has unpacked.  He's on the bed, on his CELLULAR...

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 You should be able to take a shower
                 and still have hot water left, honey.
                       (listens)
                 Call him back and tell him I said
                 so.  The goddamn thing's still under
                 warranty.
                       (listens)
                 I'm okay.  It's hard here.  It's
                 hard.
                       (listens)
                 I've got a lead I have to follow
                 through.  To be honest, I don't
                 think I'm going to get very far.
                 I miss you.  I love you.


     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, KITCHEN -- MORNING

     Welles sits at the kitchen table.  Mrs. Mathews makes
     coffee.  The home's decor is cheap and flowery.

                             MRS MATHEWS 
                 We weren't religious.  We never
                 forced religion down her throat,
                 like I've seen some parents do to
                 their kids.  We never made her go to
                 church.  But, after Mary was gone,
                 that's when I got religious.

     Mrs. Mathews brings two cups of coffee, sits.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Doesn't make much sense, does it?
                 When everything's happy, when life's
                 fine and you have every reason to
                 believe there's a God, you don't
                 bother.  Then, something horrible
                 happens... that's when you start
                 praying all the time.  That's when
                 you start going to church.

                             WELLES
                 We're all like that.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Are you religious?

                             WELLES
                 No.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 You should be.

     Mrs. Mathews drinks coffee, stares into the cup.

                             WELLES
                 I've got what I need for my report.
                 There is... there is one thing that
                 bothers me though.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 What? 

                             WELLES
                 It's not really my place, but it's
                 not easy for me to set aside the
                 private detective part of me either.
                 See, I know a little about missing
                 persons.  When kids run, they almost
                 always leave a note.  It's guilt.
                 They want to say goodbye.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 There wasn't one.  The police looked.

                             WELLES
                 Do you think the police did a good
                 job?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 I don't know.  I think so.

                             WELLES
                 It is possible... and I know this
                 isn't something you want to hear.
                 Your daughter may have tried to hide
                 a note where she thought you would
                 eventually find it, but where she
                 knew your husband would never find
                 it.  She might have wanted to tell
                 you something...

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 No.  You don't have any reason to
                 think that...

                             WELLES
                 If the police focused their search
                 in <u>her</u> room, <u>her</u> belongings, well
                 that'd be only natural, but they may
                 have been looking in the wrong place.

     Mrs. Mathews is getting upset.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 How... how can you say that to me...?

                             WELLES
                 Will you let me look?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 My husband never laid a hand on her.
                 She would have told me... she would
                 have told me...

                             WELLES 
                 You're probably right, and I
                 probably won't find anything.
                 I don't have a right to ask this,
                 and you can kick me out of your
                 house if you want, but this is my
                 profession and there's a part of me
                 that can't let it go.  Police are
                 just as human as you or I.  They
                 could have missed something.  They
                 probably didn't.
                       (pause)
                 Wouldn't you rather know?

     Mrs. Mathews thinks about it, tortured, shakes her head sadly.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Go ahead and look if you want.  I
                 don't care what you do.

     Mrs. Mathews gets up and walks out of the room.


     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE -- SEARCH MONTAGE -- DAY

     -In MRS. MATHEWS' BEDROOM, Welles looks through DRESSER
      drawers, methodically, replacing everything as it was...
      searches hat boxes and shoe boxes in a CLOSET... takes
      BOOKS off SHELVES, fanning the pages, shaking them out...

     -In a BATHROOM, Welles examines the contents of a MEDICINE
      CABINET, examining old prescription bottles... opens
      CABINETS under the sink...

     -In the LIVING ROOM, Mrs. Mathews sits slumped in a chair,
      staring at a soap opera on TELEVISION, a BOTTLE of scotch
      on TV tray beside her, drink in hand.

     -In the KITCHEN, Welles stands on a chair, searches high
      CABINETS... looks through low CABINETS, on his knees, pulls
      out pots and pans... fans the pages of COOK BOOKS...

     -Welles stands in the doorway of MARY'S ROOM, just stares.
      He takes a few steps back into the HALLWAY, looks up at the
      ceiling.  There's an ATTIC DOOR there.  Welles reaches to
      the door's handle, opens it, unfolds the portable stairs...

      -In the small ATTIC, Welles uses a penlight FLASHLIGHT,
      crouched under the low ceiling, looking through dusty BOXES
      of PHOTOGRAPHS; old photos of a wedding, of grandparents...
      Welles moves to pull back dusty sheets, finds a large
      WICKER BASKET and broken BICYCLE underneath...

      Welles opens the basket, takes out BLANKETS and QUILTS
      in mothballs.  He finds a wide VELVET BOX, takes it out,
      opens its hinged lid to reveal a set of good SILVERWARE.
      He touches the tarnished silverware, lifts out the top tray.
      Underneath, resting on top of more silverware, is a DIARY.

      Welles opens the DIARY, finds written: "<b>Mary Anne Mathews.</b>"

      Welles turns pages.  The DIARY'S about half-full of
      feminine, cursive handwriting.  After the last written
      page, a PAGE has been TORN OUT.  Welles fingers the ragged
      edge, flips through the blank pages till he comes to the
      very last page, a GOODBYE NOTE.  Welles sits and reads...

                             MARY'S VOICE (V.O.)
                       (emotionless monotone)
                 "Dear mom.  If you're reading this,
                 it means I called you from
                 Hollywood, California and told you
                 where to find my diary.  I don't
                 think I'll be able to tell you this
                 when I talk to you, so I'm writing
                 it down here.  You know I haven't
                 been happy for a long, long time.
                 For a long time now dad's been doing
                 things I couldn't tell you.  He's
                 been touching me and it's getting
                 worse.  I can't stay anymore.  I
                 know you and I haven't always gotten
                 along sometimes, but please don't
                 blame yourself.  There isn't
                 anything you can do.  I'm going to
                 make a whole new life in California.
                 Maybe someday you'll see me on TV or
                 in magazines.  Don't worry about me.
                 Love, Mary Anne."

     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, HALLWAY OUTSIDE MARY'S ROOM -- DAY

     Welles shuts the attic door, takes the DIARY from his
     pocket, hides it in his waistband at the small of his back.

     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- DAY

     Welles enters.  Mrs. Mathews looks up from the TV.

                             WELLES
                 You were right.
                       (pause)
                 I didn't find anything.  I'm going
                 to run and get something to eat.
                 Are you hungry?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Yes.


     INT.  COPY SHOP -- LATE DAY

     Welles uses a self-serve COPY MACHINE, flattening the DIARY
     on the glass, photocopying the DIARY as quickly as he can.


     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles sits picking at fast food in front of him.  Mrs.
     Mathews' food isn't even unwrapped. 

     She's numb from her drink, watching a GAME SHOW, smoking. 

                             WELLES
                 Do you ever consider... do you
                 realize that Mary may never come
                 back?

     Mrs. Mathews looks to Welles, looks back at the TV.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 I think about it everyday.  But,
                 every time the phone rings... every
                 single time, I still think it's her.

                             WELLES
                 It's been six years.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 What am I supposed to do?  Forget
                 her?  Time heals all wounds, right?
                       (misery building)
                 She's all I think about, and I've
                 learned to live with that.  But, you
                 want the truth... the real truth?
                 If I had a choice... if I had to
                 choose, between her being out there,
                 living a good life and being happy,
                 and me not knowing; never finding
                 out what happened to her...
                       (pause)
                 ... or her being dead and me
                 knowing...
                       (pause)
                 I'd choose to know.

     Mrs. Mathews stares into the TV, wipes tears.
     Welles takes a deep breath and holds it.  He watches her a
     long moment, motionless.  Finally he stands, voice unsteady.

                             WELLES
                 Excuse me, I have to use your
                 bathroom.

     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, HALLWAY OUTSIDE MARY'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles comes to the attic door, quietly pulls it open.

     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, ATTIC -- NIGHT

     Welles uses his penlight, digs out the DIARY from the hiding
     place in his waistband, replaces it in the box of
     silverware, closes the box.

     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, MARY'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles enters, takes a PICTURE FRAME off one shelf, opens
     the back and takes out the PHOTO of MARY from inside.

     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Mrs. Mathews still gazes into the TV.  Welles passes the
     doorway, not looking in, heading to the front door, opening
     the door and walking out...

     Mrs. Mathews doesn't even notice, doesn't look up.

     EXT.  MATHEWS HOUSE -- NIGHT

     Welles crosses the front lawn, not looking back, heading to
     the street, getting into his car, starting his car, doing a
     U-turn, driving away down the street.


     EXT.  FAYETTEVILLE AIRPORT, LONG TERM PARKING -- MORNING

     Welles' boxes of belongings are piled in the back seat of
     his car.  Welles covers them with a blanket, shuts the door.

     Welles opens the trunk of his car, pulls back the carpeting.
     He opens the brown BRIEFCASE.  The briefcase is full of
     CASH, about $10,000, twenties and fifties in bundles.

     Welles transfers half the money into a carry-on bag, shuts
     the briefcase, covers it, closes the trunk.


     INT.  AIRPLANE, COACH -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

     The cabin's half-full, dark.  Passengers sleep.  Under the
     only illuminated reading light, Welles reads the PHOTOCOPIED
     DIARY.  MARY'S VOICE is a again a flat monotone...

                             <b>MARY'S VOICE</b> (V.O.)
                       (as Welles reads)
                 "Dear diary.  I have a big math test
                 tomorrow.  I have to get better
                 grades.  How come everybody does
                 better than me?  Kathy doesn't even
                 study and she gets B's.  Two boys
                 got in a fight after school today.
                 One boy knocked the other boy's
                 tooth out, at least that's what it
                 looked like.  His nose and mouth
                 were bleeding all over the place..."

     INT.  HOLLYWOOD HOTEL -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     Welles' suitcase is open on the bed.  Welles sits in a chair

                             <b>MARY'S VOICE</b> (V.O.)
                       (as Welles reads)
                 "... We're reading The Great Gatsby
                 in English class.  It's the story of
                 this guy who has lots of fancy
                 parties and all his friends come
                 around and party with him, but later
                 when he dies nobody comes to his
                 funeral.  Someone said there's a
                 movie about it, but I looked in the
                 video store and it wasn't there."

     Welles flips pages, further back in the DIARY...

                             <b>MARY'S VOICE</b> (V.O.)
                       (as Welles reads)

                 cheese that comes out of a pump.  I
                 don't know what I'd do if I'm still

                 Hospitals smell like dead people."

     EXT.  FREEWAY -- <u>HELICOPTER SHOT</u> -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

     FOLLOW Welles' car speeding along...

                             <b>MARY'S VOICE</b> (V.O., cont)
                 "Dear diary.  It's happening all the
                 time now.  There s nothing I can do.
                 I'm all alone.  Everything is bad.
                 I used to have lots of dreams and
                 I'd remember them when I woke up,
                 but that doesn't happen anymore."

     PULL BACK: still FOLLOWING WELLES' CAR, over the FREEWAY...

                             <b>MARY'S VOICE</b> (V.O., cont)
                 "Dear diary.  If I can get to
                 California, I'll be okay.  I've got
                 money saved.  I can work as a
                 waitress till I get something
                 better.  Billy says he and his
                 family went to California once on
                 vacation.  He says it never rains.
                 They stayed near the beach and he
                 went swimming in the ocean..."

     CONTINUE TO PULL BACK -- till Welles' car is very, very far
     below -- REVEALING the staggering size of the City of Los
     Angeles, where the lights go on forever and forever.

     INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

     Welles is seated, elbows on his knees, reading the DIARY...

                             <b>MARY'S VOICE</b> (V.O., cont)
                 "... I hope I can be an actress.  I
                 hope I can be happy.  I'll probably
                 have to go to acting school.  I wish
                 I knew someone who lived there.
                 I'll miss my friends, but at least
                 I'll be far away where no one can
                 ever find me."

     Welles has come to the end of the writing in the DIARY.  The
     next PHOTOCOPIED PAGE shows an image of the TORN RAGGED EDGE
     of the diary's missing page.


     EXT.  VIDEO PORN SHOP -- DAY

     Welles enters this "ADULT VIDEO" storefront.

     INT.  VIDEO PORN SHOP -- DAY

     The CLERK is a sleazy forty-year-old man with rings in his
     pierced nose and lips, behind a counter by the door.  He
     watches Welles pass.

     Welles looks around, uncomfortable.  A few of the other
     CUSTOMERS, all men, sneak glances at Welles.  Display
     shelves run floor to ceiling, full of hundreds of shrink-
     wrapped XXX PORNO TAPES.  Welles pretends to browse.

     Handmade signs above each section identify content: "ANAL,"
     "BIG TITS," "CUMSHOTS," "BONDAGE and FETISH," etc...

     Welles looks back at the clerk, who stares at Welles.
     Welles feels obligated to pick up a box and act like he's
     considering it.  He glances at other customers.

     Each man keeps his eyes forward on the pornography.  One guy
     has his arms full of about ten videos.

     Welles puts the tape back, walks to the front counter.  The
     clerk watches him the whole time.

                             WELLES
                 Is this pretty much it?

     The clerk just stares at Welles.

                             WELLES
                 Just... just videos?

                             PIERCED CLERK
                 What are you looking for?

     Welles considers, decides to leave, exiting...

                             WELLES
                 Nothing.

                             PIERCED CLERK
                 Fuck-head.


     INT.  ADULT BOOKSTORE -- DAY

     Welles comes in through the blacked-out door.  This place is
     larger than the last.  TWO CLERKS are behind the counter.
     One clerk's pricing porn, the other, MAX, 25, reads a porno-
     novel.  Max has long hair, colorful tattoos covering his
     forearms, has a HIGHLIGHTER MARKER in his mouth.

     Welles browses.  There's a huge video bargain bin.  Walls
     are covered in videos, sex toys, inflatable women, etc. 

     CUSTOMERS, again all wary males, follow proper porn-shop
     etiquette; look at the porn, not your fellow shopper.

     There are "PEEP SHOW" booths in the back.  A MAN looks
     around, trying to be nonchalant, sweating profusely,
     slipping behind one curtain.

     Welles pretends to read the packaging on a triple-pack of
     dildos, looks towards the front...

     Behind the register, Max takes a look to make sure the other
     clerk is busy, takes the cap of his Highlighter pen and
     highlights a section in the book he's reading.

     Welles notes this.  He goes to the substantial MAGAZINE
     RACK, picks up a porn tabloid, pages through it.  He selects
     sex MAGAZINES and NEWSPAPERS, choosing about twenty-five.

     Welles takes this pile up to Max, gets out his wallet.  Max
     starts ringing everything up.

                             MAX
                 Big date tonight?

                             WELLES
                       (embarrassed)
                 Yeah... guess so.

                             MAX 
                 Can I interest you in a battery
                 operated-vagina?

                             WELLES
                 Pardon me?

                             MAX
                 My boss tells me I have to do more
                 suggestive selling.

                             WELLES 
                 Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.

                             MAX
                 It's your call, but you're gonna be
                 sorry when you're in one of those
                 everyday situations that call for a
                 battery-operated vagina and you
                 don't have one.

                             WELLES
                 I'll risk it. 

     Max shoves everything into a bag and hands it over.

                             MAX
                 Thank you for shopping at Adult
                 Bookstore.  Have a nice day.

     Welles takes the bag.  Max returns to his book.  Welles is
     leaving, but stops at the end of the counter.

                             WELLES
                 What are you reading?

     Max holds up the book, "ANAL SECRETARY."

                             MAX
                 Once you pick it up you can't put it
                 down.

                             WELLES
                 Catchy title.  What are you really
                 reading?
                       (off Max's look)
                 Hard to believe that book's got any
                 parts worth highlighting.

     Max takes a glance at the other clerk, opens the pages of
     the book and shows it to Welles.  "<b>Music for Chameleons.</b>"

                             WELLES
                 Truman Capote.

                             MAX
                 I tear off the cover and paste this
                 one on...
                       (nods towards clerk)
                 You know how it is.

                             WELLES
                 Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself
                 in front of your fellow perverts.

                             MAX
                       (smiles, shrugs)
                 Might get drummed out of the
                 pornographer's union, and then where
                 would I be?

     Another CUSTOMER clears his throat, waiting at the register.
     Max turns to help him.  Welles heads out.


     INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles is at a table, porn publications spread out before
     him, looking through the back of a PORNO TABLOID...

     Turning pages of HARDCORE ADVERTISEMENTS: "<b>Adults Only,</b>"
     "<b>She Male Films,</b>" "<b>Amateur Sex Videos,</b>" "<b>Women and
     Animals -- you've got to see it to believe it...</b>"

     Welles moves on to the next MAGAZINE, turning to the back,
     again, page after page: "<b>Watersports and Fisting
     Specialists,</b>" "<b>100's of Anal Films,</b>" "<b>Asian Sex...</b>"

     HUNDREDS of <b>900 NUMBER</b> ads with naked women urging callers
     to pick up the phone.  <b>EROTIC CLASSIFIEDS</b>; hundreds of
     amateur photos of naked men and women with faces and
     genitalia blacked over... "<b>Men Seeking Women,</b>" "<b>Women
     Seeking Women</b>", "<b>Men Seeking Men,</b>" "<b>Transvestites...</b>"

     It is endless.  More <b>CLASSIFIEDS</b>: "<b>Sex Slaves Wanted,</b>"
     "<b>ACTRESSES WANTED,</b>" "<b>Underground Films,</b>" "<b>SPECIALTY FILMS
     OFFERED,</b>" "<b>S+M and BONDAGE,</b>" "<b>Fetish Videos.</b>"

     Welles leaves it, overwhelmed, goes to lay down on the bed.
     He picks up his cellular phone, dialing.

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Hi, honey, how are you?  How's Cindy?
                       (listens)
                 The way it's going I'm about ready
                 to pack my bags...

     INT.  NONDESCRIPT ROOM -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

     In a dark room, we don't know where, a DARK FIGURE of a MAN
     is silhouetted.  He wears HEADPHONES, <u>listening</u>...

                             WELLES' VOICE (V.O.)
                       (through headphones)
                 ... I've got a feeling the person
                 I'm looking for came out here and
                 got swallowed up by the place.

                             AMY'S VOICE (V.O.)
                       (through headphone)
                 Come back now. Just drop it and
                 come back...

                             WELLES' VOICE (V.O.)
                       (through headphone)
                 I would if I could.  I'll be home
                 soon, believe me.  It won't be long.

                             AMY'S VOICE (V.O.)
                       (through headphone)
                 I miss you.

     INT.  WELLES ROOM -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

     Welles shuts his eyes, still on the cellular...

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 I miss you too.  I love you very
                 much.  Give Cinderella a kiss for me
                 and tell her I love her, alright?
                       (listens)
                 Goodnight.


     INT.  ADULT BOOKSTORE -- DAY

     Max is at the register.  A crewcut WOMAN in overalls works
     behind the counter with him.  Welles approaches.

                             WELLES
                 Remember me?

                             MAX
                 Came back for that battery-operated
                 vagina, right?  Told you you would.

     Welles shows his IDENTIFICATION, lets Max get a good look.

                             WELLES
                 I need some information.  Thought
                 you might be able to help.

                             MAX
                       (of identification)
                 Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.

     Welles takes out an ENVELOPE, puts it on the counter.

                             WELLES
                 I'll be outside having a cigarette.

     Welles leaves.  Max watches him go.  Max opens the envelope,
     takes out two fifty dollar bills, pockets them.

                             MAX
                       (to other clerk)
                 Cover me, Beth.  I'm taking a break.

     EXT.  ADULT BOOKSTORE -- DAY

     Welles stands down the sidewalk, smoking.  Max comes out
     from the porn shop, walks to Welles, looking around.

                             MAX
                 I don't know what you're looking
                 for, mister, but so we're clear from
                 the start, I'm straight.

                             WELLES
                 Good for you.

     Welles and Max walk down the block, past HOMELESS MEN with
     shopping carts overflowing with junk.

                             WELLES
                 How long you been working there?

                             MAX
                 Three, four years.

                             WELLES
                 What's your name, if you don't mind
                 me asking? 

                             MAX
                 Max.

                             WELLES
                 Well, here's the deal, Max.  This
                 thing I'm on right now has something
                 to do with underground pornography.
                 Stuff that's sold under the counter,
                 illegally...

                             MAX
                 There's not much illegal.

                             WELLES
                 Well, whatever there is, whoever's
                 dealing, however it's done, I want
                 to know.  I want a good look, so if
                 you've got that kind of connection,
                 great.  If not, speak now.

                             MAX
                 You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask
                 and you are, you have to tell me.

                             WELLES
                 I'm not a cop.

                             MAX
                 You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.

                             WELLES
                 Not quite.

                             MAX
                 From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA.
                 What are you doing out here?

                             WELLES
                 Well, there's the thing; you're not
                 gonna know anything about what I'm
                 doing, but you can make some money.

                             MAX
                 How much?

                             WELLES
                 How much do you make now?

                             MAX
                 Four hundred a week, off the books.

                             WELLES
                 Okay, let's pretend I live in the
                 same fantasy world where you make
                 four hundred a week in that dump.
                 I'll give you six hundred for a few
                 days. 

                             MAX
                 Sounds good, pops.

                             WELLES
                 Here's my number if you need it...
                       (writes on scrap paper)
                 When can you start?

                             MAX
                 Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.

                             WELLES
                 See you then.  Oh, and, don't call
                 me "pops."

     Welles walks away. 


     INT.  WELLES ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles sleeps, despite the stead SOUND of TRAFFIC racing by
     his window.  The PHONE RINGS, waking him.  Welles looks at
     the clock radio, <b>2:23</b>am, reaches to answer the phone...

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 ... Hello... ?

                             MAX (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Wake up, pops.  Your education
                 begins tonight.

     EXT.  DOWNTOWN -- NIGHT

     Against the backdrop of downtown LA's bright skyscrapers,
     Welles' rental car heads into the lower bowels of the city,
     smaller, older, darker buildings...

     EXT.  DOWNTOWN STREETS -- NIGHT

     The only people on the street are HOMELESS and SHADY
     CHARACTERS.  Welles' car makes its way to a big deserted
     PARKING LOT.  There are a few cars parked in one corner.

     Welles parks near the other cars and gets out.  Max stands
     against a chain link fence.  Welles goes to meet him.

                             MAX
                 Come on.

     Max leads the way, across the lot, towards dark alleyways.

     EXT.  DOWNTOWN ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT

     Max and Welles move through this filth strewn alley between
     decaying brink buildings.  They cone to a STAIRWELL leading
     down to pitch dark...

     INT.  OLD BUILDING -- NIGHT

     Max enters through a crooked door, heads into a narrow,
     labyrinth hallway lit by bare bulbs.  Welles follows.

     They come to another STAIRWAY leading down.  At the bottom,
     a thick-necked GOON stands guarding double doors. 

                             GOON
                 Are you a law enforcement agent or
                 in any way affiliated with law
                 enforcement?

                             MAX
                 Fuck you, Larry.

     Max heads to the double doors, waits for Welles.

                             GOON
                       (to Welles)
                 Are you a law enforcement... ?

                             WELLES
                 No.

     INT.  BASEMENT -- NIGHT

     Max and Welles enter through the double doors, into a kind
     of small, underground porn flea market.  It's incredibly
     quiet.  About fifteen CARD TABLES are set up in rows.  The
     MEN behind the tables and the thirty or so "CUSTOMERS"
     looking through the merchandise make those in the previous
     porn shops look like high society.

     These are MIDDLE-AGED MEN, most balding, some with pot
     bellies, in shorts and tube socks, in sweatpants and Members
     Only jackets: plain men, but with a look of desperation in
     their eyes, glancing around nervously, greasy and afraid.

                             ONE DEALER
                 We're shutting down in fifteen
                 minutes.  Fifteen minutes.

     Welles makes his way to the tables, wary.  One table is
     covered in dirty cardboard boxes, filled with HUNDREDS of
     PHOTOS of young children, mostly boys, naked.  Each photo is
     wrapped in plastic, censored by masking tape.

     Welles swallows back disgust.

     The next table is piled high with used pornographic
     MAGAZINES.  There are baggies with COLORFUL PILLS laid out.
     X-rated Polaroids wrapped in rubberbands.

     Max follows behind, unaffected, smokes a cigarette.

     Another table offers VIDEO TAPES with no identifying marks
     other than hand written labels with numbers written out,
     "<b>two,</b>" "<b>sixteen,</b>" "<b>five.</b>"  And many bootleg VIDEOS with
     grainy, homemade labels showing WOMEN in extreme BONDAGE.

     Welles watches out the corner of his eye as the PLUMP MAN
     beside him pays for a thick stack of kiddie porn pictures.
     Welles waits till the man moves on, addresses the angry
     looking DEALER who's counting money.

                             WELLES
                       (points to numbered videos)
                 What are these?

                             ANGRY DEALER
                 Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films.
                 Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.

     Welles looks around, wipes sweat off his top lip.

                             WELLES
                 Anything harder?

                             ANGRY DEALER
                 There's nothing harder.

                             WELLES
                 Snuff?

                             ANGRY DEALER
                 What you see is what I got, mister.

                             WELLES
                 You know where I can get it?  I have
                 a lot of money to spend.

                             ANGRY DEALER
                 There ain't no such thing as snuff.
                 Why don't you fuck off? 

     The dealer sits and keeps counting cash.
     Welles moves on Beyond the tables there's a CURTAINED
     DOORWAY.  Welles walks to it, enters...

     INSIDE THE CURTAIN

     Folding chairs face a SCREEN.  A PROJECTOR shows a silent
     movie; a BUXOM WOMAN in nurses uniform prepares an enema bag
     and tube.  A hairy, overweight MAN lays face down on an
     examination table, naked, arms tied behind his back.

     In the darkness, a MAN shifts in his chair, grunting,
     obviously masturbating.  A few chairs away, a man is bent
     over, moving his head in the lap of SOMEONE in a BLONDE WIG.

     A LARGE MAN approaches Welles from the dark.

                             LARGE MAN
                 You have to pay to come in here. 

     Welles backs away, shuts the curtain.


     INT.  ALL-NIGHT COFFEE SHOP -- NIGHT

     Not many people in the place.  Welles drinks coffee.  Max
     eats a huge breakfast.

                             MAX
                 You've got Penthouse, Playboy,
                 Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers
                 them pornography anymore.  Then,
                 there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple
                 X.  The difference is penetration.
                 That's hardcore.  That whole
                 industry's up in the valley.
                 Writers, directors, porn stars.
                 They're celebrities, or they think
                 they are.  They pump out 150 videos
                 a week.  A <u>week</u>.  They've even got
                 a porno Academy Awards.  America
                 loves pornography.  Anybody tells
                 you they never use pornography,
                 they're lying.  Somebody's buying
                 those videos.  Somebody's out there
                 spending 900 million dollars a year
                 on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's
                 only gonna get worse.  More and more
                 you'll see perverse hardcore coming
                 into the mainstream, because that's
                 evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my
                 God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his
                 hips, how offensive!  Nowadays,
                 Mtv's showing girls dancing around
                 in thong bikinis with their asses
                 hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For
                 the porn-addict, big tits aren't big
                 enough after a while.  They have to
                 be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn
                 chicks are putting in breast
                 implants bigger than your head,
                 literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be
                 Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler,
                 Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore
                 films'll be medical films.
                 People'll be jerking off to women
                 laying around with open wounds.
                 There's nowhere else for it to go.

                             WELLES
                 Interesting theory.

                             MAX
                 What you saw tonight, we're not
                 talking about a video some dentist
                 takes home over the weekend.  We're
                 talking about stuff where people get
                 hurt.  Specialty product. 

                             WELLES
                 Child pornography.

                             MAX
                 There's two kinds of specialty
                 product; legal and illegal.  Foot
                 fetish, shit films, watersports,
                 bondage, spanking, fisting, she-
                 males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond
                 hardcore, but legal.  This is the
                 kind of hardcore where one guy's
                 going to look at it and throw up,
                 another guy looks at it and falls in
                 love.  Now, with some of the S+M and
                 bondage films, they straddle the
                 line.  How are you supposed to tell
                 if the person tied up with the ball
                 gag in their mouth is a consenting
                 or not?  Step over that line, you're
                 into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but
                 there aren't many.  I've never seen
                 one.

                             WELLES
                 Snuff films.

                             MAX
                 I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't
                 yanking you around.  There's no such
                 thing.

                             WELLES
                 What other ways are there to get
                 illegal films?  Who do you see?

                             MAX
                 First of all, basement sales like
                 tonight aren't gonna last much
                 longer.  It's too risky, one, and
                 two, everything's going on the
                 internet.  Anyone with a computer
                 and enough patience can find
                 anything he wants.  It's heaven for
                 those degenerate chicken-hawks.
                 They're swapping pictures back and
                 forth as fast as their modems can
                 zap 'em.  But, there's still some
                 weird shit under the counter where
                 I work sometimes.  No one knows where
                 it comes from.  That's local
                 underground, where information
                 spreads by word of mouth.  Those are
                 zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their
                 hands are permanently pruned.  They
                 go out in the sun they don't burn,
                 they blister.  Other than that, all
                 I know about is the mail.
                 Classified ads in the paper with
                 hidden codes.  Secret couriers.
                 Credit card orders to dummy
                 corporations.  Interstate wire
                 transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes.
                 But, if you're asking me who do you
                 go to to get illegal shit... who
                 knows?  That's the whole point --
                 the seller stays as far away from
                 the buyer as possible, and vice
                 versa, and cops can't trace the
                 deal.  There's ways to do it so
                 nobody knows who anybody is.

     Welles watches Max eat.

                             WELLES
                 How old are you?

                             MAX
                 Twenty-five.

                             WELLES
                 Where are your parents?

                             MAX
                 I don't know, where are yours?

                             WELLES
                 I don't mean any offense... but what
                 are you doing mixed up in all this?

                             MAX
                 I'm not mixed up in anything,
                 hayseed.  What are you talking about?

                             WELLES
                 You just strike me as smart enough
                 to be doing something else.

                             MAX
                 Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What
                 choices have I got?  Fuck, just
                 because I know about stuff like
                 tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I
                 work a job.  It beats pumping gas,
                 beats making hamburgers.

                             WELLES
                 You're telling me it doesn't get to
                 you?

                             MAX
                 You can't sit there all day watching
                 the parade of losers that comes into
                 that place without going numb.  So
                 what? 
                 Am I gonna go off and be a race car
                 driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for
                 President?  What about you, pops?

                             WELLES
                 What about me?

                             MAX
                 I see a ring on your finger.  You
                 have any kids?

                             WELLES
                 A daughter.

                             MAX
                 So, you have a wife and kid waiting
                 for you in Pennsylvania... what are
                 <u>you</u> doing mixed up in all this?

                             WELLES
                 Good question.

     EXT.  ALL NIGHT COFFEE SHOP -- NIGHT

     Max and Welles comes out to the sidewalk, talking.

     ACROSS THE STREET

     INSIDE A PARKED CAR, through the windshield, SOMEONE watches
     Max and Welles say goodnight.  Max walks to a waiting taxi.

     It's the sinister lawyer watching, LONGDALE, the late Mr.
     Christian's attorney, watching Welles go to his rental car.


     INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

     Welles is seated, PROJECTOR RUNNING, watching the 8MM film.

     The last of the film makes its way through, threading out.
     The take-up reel spins, the film's tail flapping...

     Welles stares at the blank white square of light projected
     onto the wall.  CELLULAR PHONE is HEARD RINGING...

     Welles finally looks to the projector, turns it off.  The
     PHONE'S RINGING.  Welles goes to sit on the bed, looking at
     the cellular phone on the bedside table.  RINGING...

     Welles lets it RING.  RINGING... RINGING... till it finally
     stops.  Welles lays back on the bed and shuts his eyes.


     INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, MR CHRISTIAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

     Mrs. Christian is behind the desk, surrounded by BOXES of
     BANK RECORDS and FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, on the PHONE. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                       (into phone)
                 My husband had five cash accounts he
                 used to temporarily hold stock
                 profits.  Between November of 1991
                 and March of 1992, he wrote one
                 check out to cash from each account.
                 He wrote these himself...

     INT.  PHONE BOOTH, HOLLYWOOD -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

     Welles is in the booth, listening...

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Okay...

                             MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 My husband never dealt with money
                 personally, certainly not cash.

                             WELLES
                 I'm not positive this means anything.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                 The checks were for odd amounts...

     INT.  MR CHRISTIAN'S OFFICE -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

     Mrs. Christian has the amounts written out on paper.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                       (into phone)
                 One was for two hundred thousand,
                 one dollar and thirteen cents.
                 Another was for three hundred
                 thousand, six hundred fifty four
                 dollars and seventy six cents...

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Okay, I follow you so far...

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                 Totalled together, these five checks
                 from five different accounts, they
                 equal one million dollars.

     INT.  PHONE BOOTH -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

                       (into phone)
                 You're joking.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 To the penny.  Exactly one million
                 dollars in cash. 

     Welles considers this, lost in thought.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                 Hello... ?

                             WELLES
                 I'm here.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                 Do you think the film could have
                 cost that much?

                             WELLES
                 For a human life... murder on film,
                 no statute of limitations.  Who
                 knows?  It sure could have.  I'd
                 like you to overnight me a copy of
                 those checks, then put them in a
                 safe deposit box. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                 Okay.

                             WELLES
                 Send it to me through the post
                 office like we arranged.  No return
                 address.  You dug this up all by
                 yourself?

                             MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                 You told me to look, so I looked.

                             WELLES
                 You're one hell of a detective, Mrs.
                 Christian.


     EXT.  MISSION YOUTH HOSTEL -- DAY

     TEENAGERS work cleaning this large DORMITORY, sweeping and
     mopping the floor, making the bunk beds, washing windows.
     Welles stands with an elderly, black NUN in plain clothing.

                             WELLES
                 Her name was Mary Anne Mathews.

     Welles hands the woman the PICTURE of MARY.  The woman puts
     on her glasses, looks at the picture... looks at Welles.

                             NUN
                 Yes... I remember Mary

                             WELLES
                 You... you do?  You're sure?
                 Please, Sister, will you take
                 another look, make sure... 

                             NUN 
                      (examines picture)
                 Yes.  I remember her.

     INT.  MISSION YOUTH HOSTEL, STORAGE AREA -- DAY

     In a basement corner, Welles watches as the nun uses keys to
     open the door of a chain-link STORAGE CAGE.  The cage is
     full of junk, BOXES, LAMPS, stacks of CHAIRS.

                             NUN
                 She lived here for only about a
                 month, if I recall correctly.  She
                 didn't return one night.  She never
                 came back.  I didn't know what to
                 think...

     The nun enters the cage, pushes old BOXES out of her way,
     looks up a cob-web covered METAL SHELVES.

                             NUN
                 Do you know what happened to her?

                             WELLES
                 I'm trying to find out.  She was a
                 runaway.  I'm looking into it for
                 her parents.

     The nun sees what she wants, finds a STEP LADDER, tries to
     open it.  Welles comes to help her.

                             NUN
                       (pointing on shelf)
                 Can you get that down for me?

     Welles climbs the ladder, points at boxes...

                             NUN
                 No, the next shelf... there...

     Welles takes down a small SUITCASE.  It's covered in dust.
     He climbs down the ladder with it.

                             WELLES
                 What is this?

                             NUN
                 Those are her belongings.

                             WELLES
                 Her belongings?

                             NUN
                 That's her suitcase.  I had
                 forgotten it, till you showed me
                 her picture.

     Welles puts the suitcase down, examines the LUGGAGE TAG:
     "<b>Mary Anne Mathews,</b>" no address.  Welles looks to the nun. 

                             WELLES
                 Whatever possessed you to keep this
                 all this time?

                             NUN
                 She was the kindest, sweetest girl
                 you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I
                 adored her.  I supposed I always
                 hoped she'd be back.  After a time,
                 all I could do was pray she had
                 moved on to better things.  Can you
                 get this suitcase to her parents, if
                 you think it's appropriate?

                             WELLES
                 I'll do what I can.


     INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles puts Mary's SUITCASE on the bed, opens it.  He takes
     out some of Mary's clothing, examines it, lays it aside.

     He takes out a ROSARY, more CLOTHING.  Resting on a SWEATER
     are two CERAMIC FIGURINES; a teddy bear and kitten.  Welles
     examines them, frowning, puts them aside.

     He takes out yellowed NEWSPAPER; Help Wanted CLASSIFIEDS,
     "<b>July 2, 1992.</b>"  Several job possibilities circled, others
     crossed out.  He finds baggie containing a few old JOINTS.

     All that's left are more items of CLOTHING, a TOOTHBRUSH and
     an ADDRESS BOOK.  Welles examines the address book, finds a
     folded piece of paper in the blank pages, unfolds it... it's
     the TORN DIARY PAGE, a POEM written in Mary's hand...

                             <b>MARY'S VOICE</b> (V.O.)
                       (as Welles reads)
                 "Star light, star bright, First star
                 I've seen tonight, Wish I may, wish
                 I might, Have this wish I wish
                 tonight."

     Welles goes to a drawer, takes out the photocopy of Mary's
     DIARY.  He turns to the ragged edge of the torn page, puts
     the DIARY PAGE against it.  Perfect match.

     Welles stands looking at the poem.  He turns the page over,
     finds written, in cursive:

                           <b>Models Wanted 213-555-6643</b>


     EXT.  PHONE BOOTH -- DAY

     Welles dials the number off the back of the torn diary page,
     phone to his ear.  It RINGS, RINGS, RINGS... 

                             MAN'S VOICE (V.O.) 
                       (from phone)
                 Celebrity Films.

     Welles hangs up, begins searching the booth's YELLOW PAGES.

     EXT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY

     A poverty stricken business section of Wilshire.  Welles
     gets out of his parked car, looks up at a decaying Art Deco
     building that's painted blue top-to-bottom.

     Welles crosses through traffic.

     INT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, LOBBY -- DAY

     Welles studies the REGISTRY, finds "<b>Celebrity Films.</b>"

     INT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- DAY

     Paint's peeling.  Walls are water stained.  Welles climbs
     stairs, winded, sweating, up the stairwell...

     INT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, 8TH FLOOR HALL -- DAY

     Welles comes out a stairwell DOOR, catching his breath.  A
     couple of SECRETARIES wait for the elevator.  Welles moves
     down the hall, around a corner.

     Each office door has a window of pebbled, translucent glass.
     There's a "Dental Office," "Wilson Travel Cruises," and at
     the end of the hall, "<b>Celebrity Films Inc., Eddie Poole,
     Professional Casting and Distribution, Suite 804.</b>"

     Welles heads back the way he came.

     EXT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY

     Welles crosses back to the other side of the street, goes to
     stand near his car.  He looks up at the blue office
     building, counting up floors, counting windows across.

     Satisfied, he turns, backing up, looking up at the tall
     OFFICE BUILDING across from the blue building.  There's a
     sign on this adjacent building, "<b>OFFICE SPACE AVAILABLE.</b>"

     INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE, 9TH FLOOR -- DAY

     Empty office.  Welles is let in by a disinterested LANDLORD.
     Welles gives a cursory look around, goes to the windows and
     opens the blinds.

     These windows afford an excellent view of the blue building
     across the street, at about 8th floor level.

                             WELLES 
                 This is better. 
                       (turns to landlord) 
                 This will be fine.


     INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- NIGHT

     Welles has transferred most of his belongings here, SUITCASE
     open on the floor, CARD TABLE set up with fast food on it,
     an ARMY COT against one wall.  Welles sits in a chair at the
     window, looks through BINOCULARS on a TRIPOD.

     WELLES' P.O.V., THROUGH BINOCULARS: searching up the dark
     floors of the blue building, as Welles counts under his
     breath.  Moving over... stopping on one window, FOCUSING...

     Welles locks the tripod.  He goes to sit on the army cot,
     picks up his CELLULAR.  He looks at the phone, deciding.
     He puts down the phone.  He turns off the LAMP on the floor,
     lays back in the cot, going to sleep.


     INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY

     WELLES' P.O.V., THROUGH BINOCULARS: watching the window of
     Celebrity Films Inc.  We can see most of the office from
     here.  It's crowded with junk, BOXES, piles of VIDEO TAPES.
     There's a disorganized DESK by the window.

     Welles sits looking through the binoculars.

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: a pudgy man, EDDIE POOLE, in a loud,
     print shirt, comes to sit at the desk, looks through mail.
     He smells sleazy even from here, lots of jewelry, Lots of
     rings.  He drinks coffee, answers the phone.  He talks into
     the phone, looking for something on his desk, agitation
     growing, till he's shouting, then slams the phone down.

     Welles rises.  He looks to the wall where THREE PHOTOGRAPHS
     culled from the snuff film are pinned up; the picture of
     Mary, the picture of Masked Man's tattooed hand, and...

     ... the grainy image of the Third Man in the mirror.
     Welles comes to study this third photo.

                                              FADE TO BLACK:

     INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie packs VIDEO TAPES into a box,
     covering them with Styrofoam peanuts, sealing the box.

                                              FADE TO BLACK:

     INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie finishes a call and hangs up.  He
     sits back in his chair.  He starts looking in his desk
     drawers, finds a MAGAZINE and opens it on the desk.  It's
     porn.  Eddie turns pages, looking at naked women.  He sits
     back in his chair, begins unbuckling his belt.

     Welles pulls back from the binoculars in disgust. 

                             WELLES 
                 No thank you.

                                              FADE TO BLACK:

     INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- NIGHT

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie's on the phone, pouring himself a
     drink from the liquor bottle on his desk, finishing the
     call, hanging up.  He shakes his head in disgust, drinks the
     drink, walks out of view.  After a moment, the lights go out.

     EXT.  HOLLYWOOD HILLS -- NIGHT

     An old, dented CAR makes its way up the tight, twisting
     roads of the Hollywood Hills.  Eddie's at the wheel.  Not
     far behind, Welles' rental car follows...

     FURTHER ON

     Eddie's car pulls into the driveway under the porch of a
     ramshackle HOUSE, parks.  Welles' car passes by...

     FURTHER, AROUND A CURVE

     Welles' car slows once it's out of sight, turns around,
     moving back down the hill, slowly...

     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- CONTINUOUS

     Welles turns out his headlights, coming around the curve
     just far enough so the ramshackle house is in view.  Welles
     watches Eddie walk up the stairs to the house.

                                              FADE TO BLACK:

     INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie has a visitor.  There's a pretty
     GIRL, wearing a tube top, in a chair facing his desk.
     Eddie's talking, gesticulating, smiling, cajoling.

     Welles watches through binoculars.

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie's still taking, stands, coming
     around the desk and placing a hand on the girl's shoulder.
     The girl says something.  Eddie responds.  The woman shakes
     her head, getting up to leave.  Eddie seems to be asking her
     to stay, following as she moves out of view.  Eddie comes
     back alone, sits at his desk, picks up the phone.


     INT.  ESPIONAGE SHOP -- DAY

     Ultra high tech for sale.  Welles examines items on the
     sales counter as the SALESPERSON watches: a pair of sma1l,
     round LISTENING DEVICES, a complicated RECEIVER/TAPE
     RECORDER, and a TONE DECODER with LED window.

                             WELLES 
                 Okay, I'll take it all.

                             SALESPERSON 
                 Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and
                 American Express.

                             WELLES
                 Cash.

     Welles takes out a thick wad, starts counting.

                             SALESPERSON
                 Alright.
                       (at register) 
                 May I have your phone number, area
                 code first?

                             WELLES
                 No, you may not.

                             SALESPERSON
                 Okay.  Fine.

     Welles lays the money on the counter.  The salesperson takes
     the money, recounting.

                             SALESPERSON
                 I'm required by state law to inform
                 you that, while it's perfectly legal
                 for you to purchase these items, it
                 is illegal for you to use them for
                 any sort of...

                             WELLES
                 Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you
                 could bag it, I'll be on my way,
                 thank you.

                             SALESPERSON
                 Certainly, sir.

     The salesperson starts punching keys on the register.


     EXT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING -- NIGHT

     The blue building sits completely dark.

     INT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, 8TH FLOOR HALL -- NIGHT

     Welles comes quietly out from the stairwell, wears gloves.
     He moves down the hall to the door of "Celebrity Films Inc."

     He kneels, begins using LOCK-PICKING TOOLS on the door.

     INT.  CELEBRITY FILMS OFFICE -- NIGHT

     Welles enters, shuts the door and locks it.  He takes out
     his penlight.  There are POSTERS for cheap PORN FILMS on the
     wall that we couldn't see through binoculars.  Titles like
     "Sex Doctor," "Deep Ass," and "Penal Colony."

     There a two FILE CABINETS.  Welles pulls a few drawers,
     finds them locked.  VIDEO CASSETTES are everywhere, on the
     cabinets, on shelves, piled high on the floor.

     Welles goes to Eddie's desk, looking in drawers.  One drawer
     is full of X-RATED MAGAZINES.  Another's stuffed with
     paperwork, call sheets, contracts.

     Welles picks up Eddie's phone, unscrews the earpiece.  He
     takes the small, round LISTENING DEVICE from his pocket,
     peels off backing to expose adhesive.  He attaches the
     listening device inside the phone, puts it back together.

     Welles moves towards the door, sweeps the room with the
     penlight.  He stops at the file cabinets, takes his lock-
     picking tools out, begins working on one file's lock.

     He turns the lock, opens a file drawer.  Empty.  He opens
     another.  Inside: piles of CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.

     Welles clenches his jaw.

     Faces of children.  Shirtless boys.  Girls in pigtails.


     INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY

     Welles' RECEIVER/TAPE RECORDER'S set up by the window,
     recording, with the TONE DECODER plugged into it.  Welles
     LISTENS through HEADPHONE, looking through binoculars.

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                       (through headphones)
                 ... half a dozen.  This is good
                 stuff, Jimbo...

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie's at his desk, on the PHONE...

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 You know how my tapes sell.  People
                 eat this stuff up.

                             MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 I had three jerkoffs trying to
                 return your tapes last month.  Do
                 you know how bad a skin flick has to
                 be for some jackass to come back
                 into my place with a fucking receipt,
                 and try to fucking return it? 

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 Maybe there's something wrong with
                 the scumbag customers coming into
                 your place, ever think of that?

                             MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                 The only thing wrong is the cheap,
                 softcore crap you're peddling,
                 Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 Look, you cocksucker...

                             MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                 Get together some upscale product
                 where the girls still have teeth in
                 their head.  Till then, fuck you.

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 Fuck you!

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie slams down the phone.  He CANNOT
     BE HEARD any longer.  He's cursing, shuffling paperwork.

     Welles takes off headphones, picks up his cellular phone.
     He drinks soda, opens the phone, dials, nervous, then looks
     back through the binoculars.  He waits, clears his throat.
     The PHONE'S RINGING... RINGING...

     On the floor, the REELS of the tape recorder are TURNING...

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie answers the phone...

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 Celebrity Films.

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 Eddie.

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 Yeah, who's this?

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 I know what you did.

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 What?

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 I know what you did.

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 Who is this.

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six
                 years ago... 

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 What the fuck are you.. ?

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 You killed that girl and you put it
                 on film.  You and your pals, you're
                 fucked.  You fucked up real good.

     Welles hits disconnect, still looking through binoculars.

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie's slow to hang up the phone.  He
     stands, looking down at the phone, frozen.  Finally, he runs
     his hands through his hair, looks around the room, sits back
     down.  He gets out his bottle and pours himself a drink.

     Welles watches through binoculars, puts headphones back on.

                             WELLES
                 Come on, Eddie...

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie sits motionless.

                             WELLES (O.S.)
                 ... come on...

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie picks up the phone, DIALS a
     NUMBER.  We hear the PHONE RING in the HEADPHONES

                             MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                       (through headphones)
                 ... Hello?

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                       (through headphones)
                 Dino, it's Eddie... Eddie Poole...

                             DINO (V.O.)
                 What do you want?

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 I just got a call... two seconds
                 ago, some motherfucker called...
                 says he knows about the loop.

                             DINO (V.O.)
                 What are you talking about?

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 The loop!  The girl we did, what the
                 fuck do you think I'm talking
                 about?!  This guy calls and says he
                 knows about the fucking loop...

                             DINO (V.O.)
                 Bullshit.

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 I'm telling you... 

                             DINO (V.O.)
                 Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's
                 impossible.  Why are you bothering
                 me with this... ?

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 Because somebody just fucking called
                 me and fucking laid it out!

                             DINO (V.O.)
                 There's nothing there, you brain-
                 dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's
                 absolutely no way in this world to
                 connect us to anything.  I want you
                 to hang the phone up, and if you
                 call me about this again I'm going
                 to send a friend of mine out there
                 and have him crack you open with a
                 fucking rib spreader.

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 Dino...

                             DINO (V.O)
                 Nobody knows anything.

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: as DINO is HEARD HANGING UP, Eddie
     reacts, picks up his phone and throws it across the office.

     Welles sits back, trying to accept the realization that he's
     found them.  He looks to the PHOTO of the Third Man.

                             WELLES
                 That is you, isn't it, Eddie?

     Welles goes to the RECORDER, turns on the TONE DECODER.  Its
     LED window LIGHTS UP.  Welles hits STOP, REWIND, PLAY...

                             WELLES VOICE (V.O.)
                       (from recorder)
                 ... and your pals, you're fucked...

     Hits FAST FORWARD... hits PLAY, watching the TONE DECODER.
     From the RECORDER, the SOUND of EDDIE DIALING a NUMBER on
     his touch tone phone... and as EACH TONE is HEARD, a
     <u>corresponding NUMBER appears on the DECODER'S LED readout</u>:

                               <b>...1 212 555 9906...</b>

     The recorder continues, REPLAYING the CONVERSATION between
     Eddie and Dino, while Welles studies the green LED digits.

                             WELLES
                       (quiet, to himself)
                 Two one two.


     EXT.  MANHATTAN CITYSCAPE -- ESTABLISHING -- NIGHT

     The brilliant lights of New York's peerless skyscrapers.

     EXT.  59TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT

     FOLLOW Welles' Ford as it moves along with traffic, crossing
     the 59th Street Bridge, into the heart of Manhattan.

     EXT.  BANK -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY

     "Chase Manhattan Bank," mid-town.

     INT.  CHASE MANHATTAN BANK, SAFE DEPOSIT BOOTH -- DAY

     Welles puts the 8MM FILM into SAFE DEPOSIT DRAWER, shuts it.


     INT.  NY PUBLIC LIBRARY, REFERENCE -- DAY

     Busy and crowded, but quiet.  Welles places a massive tome
     down on a table:  "<b>Haines Criss-Cross Directory.</b>"

     Welles sits, takes out his notepad, referring to the phone
     number written: "<b>(212) 555-9906.</b>"  He opens the reference
     book, searching pages...

     Thousands of TELEPHONE NUMBERS are LISTED in SEQUENCE, each
     with an address.  Welles runs his finger down the page.

     EXT.  SOHO STREETS -- DAY

     PEDESTRIANS everywhere.  Streets are clogged with DELIVERY
     TRUCKS loading and unloading.  Cars horns blow.  Welles
     walks to an old, WAREHOUSE BUILDING shoulder to shoulder
     with other buildings, labeled "<b>1204</b>" in burnished steel.

     Welles climbs the stairs, examines the buzzers.

     The top button's labeled "Greystone Imports," the bottom
     button reads "Lang Interior Design, by appt."  The middle
     button is labeled only by a drawing of a BLACK WIDOW SPIDER.

     Welles looks up at the building.

     EXT.  1204 WAREHOUSE, SOHO -- LATER DAY

     The sun is low.  Less activity on the street.  Welles leans
     against a car down the street, smoking a cigarette.

     TWO WOMEN walk this way, both in spiked high heels, dressed
     in cheap, short, formfitting skirts, both carrying duffel
     bags.  They start up the stairs of 1204...

     Welles throws his cigarette, walks to follow.

     The women hit the center button.  A BUZZER sounds as they
     head inside.  Welles hurries up the stairs, catching the
     door before it closes.

     INT.  1204 WAREHOUSE, ELEVATOR -- DAY

     Welles follows the women into a decrepit ELEVATOR.  One
     woman hits "2."  Welles hits "3," steps back in the corner.
     Elevator doors creak closed.  The two women are heavily made
     up, pretty, but worn, eyes dull.

     Welles looks down at the leg of one woman, noticing bruises
     through her fishnet stockings, poorly covered by make-up.

     Elevator doors open on the SECOND FLOOR.  The two women get
     out and walk down a grey hallway, towards DOUBLE DOORS
     painted black.  Welles stops the elevator door from closing.

     The women push the INTERCOM at the black doors.  Another
     dull BUZZ is HEARD as the women enter.  The low rumble of
     HEAVY METAL MUSIC is HEARD, SILENCED as doors swing shut.

     Welles lets the elevator close.

     EXT.  1204 WAREHOUSE -- DAY

     The elevator opens on the FIRST FLOOR.  Welles gets out,
     instead of leaving the way he came, heads towards the
     rear... FOLLOW him down a hallway, past a SERVICE ELEVATOR...

     EXT.  1204 WAREHOUSE -- DAY

     Welles comes out BACK DOORS into an sunless alleyway with
     fire escapes above.  There's a TRASH DUMPSTER, overflowing.
     Rats scatter upon Welles, arrival.

     Welles looks to make sure he's alone.  He starts tearing
     open GARBAGE BAGS.  Flies swarm.  One bag's filled with
     empty food containers and old newspapers.

     Welles tears open another bag, finds burnt out FLORESCENT
     LIGHTBULBS, digs out a handful of empty PHOTO PAPER
     PACKAGES, bottles of DEVELOPING CHEMICALS.  He pulls out a
     few MAGAZINES; Time, Newsweek, etc...

     The magazines are cut up, falling apart, with pictures
     chopped out from many pages.  Welles examines ADDRESS LABELS:

     <b>"Dino Velvet/D.V. Films
      1204 Keller Street
      New York, NY 10049</b>"

     INT.  PHONE BOOTH, NYC STREETS -- NIGHT

     Welles is on the PHONE.  The city bustles past.

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 What do you know about a guy called
                 Dino Velvet?  Dino Velvet Films?

     INT.  ADULT BOOKSTORE -- DAY -- INTERCUT

     Max is on the phone by the register, ringing purchases.

                             MAX
                       (into phone)
                 Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the
                 John Luc Godard of S+M flicks,
                 supposed to be a real weirdo.

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd
                 have thought it?

                             MAX
                       (into phone)
                 His stuff comes out of New York.
                 Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic
                 Hardcore.  Definitely not for the
                 squeamish.

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 Specialty product.

                             MAX
                 You're learning.

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 Where does he sell it?

                             MAX
                 Out of the back of bondage magazines
                 mostly, but you can find it on the
                 street if you look.  He'll also do
                 commissions, for enough money...

     INT.  PHONE BOOTH -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

                             MAX (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Nothing illegal, it's always
                 borderline.  Like if some freak
                 wants to see a transvestite in a
                 full rubber immersion suit getting
                 an enema from a...

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Alright, I get the picture.

                             MAX (V.O.)
                 He cuts all kinds of other stuff
                 into his movies; photographs,
                 newsreel footage, subliminal images.
                 Thinks he's making art.

                             WELLES 
                 Well, I'm in New York now.  What do
                 you say to flying out and giving me
                 a hand?

                             MAX (V.O.)
                 I'm a working stiff, pops.

                             WELLES
                 Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four
                 hundred a day, plus expenses.

                             MAX (V.O.)
                 You want me to come out there and
                 play private eye?

                             WELLES
                 Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up
                 whatever Dino Velvet films you can.
                 Get receipts.  I'll call back.

                             MAX (V.O.)
                 See ya.

     Welles hangs up, starts feeding quarters into the phone.

     INT.  MRS. CHRISTIAN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

     Mrs. Christian's in bed, pale and sickly.  The PHONE RINGS.
     Mrs. Christian reaches for it.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                       (into phone, weakly)
                 Hello?

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                       (coughing)
                 How are you?  Having any luck?

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 I don't know if luck's the word.
                 Are you feeling alright?

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                 I've been ordered into bed.  The
                 doctor says I've gotten the flu, or
                 some other wretched ailment.

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 I hope it's nothing serious.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                 Nothing more than a bother.  Have
                 you any news for me?

     INT.  PHONE BOOTH -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 I've made progress.  I'm in
                 Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces
                 fall into place, I'll drive to you
                 and give you an update.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Fine...

     MRS. CHRISTIAN is HEARD COUGHING.  Welles waits.

                             WELLES
                 I've got about five thousand left in
                 cash, but I'll need another thirty,
                 if you approve.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                 How will I get it to you?

                             WELLES
                 If you have a pencil and paper, I'll
                 tell you how to send it.


     EXT.  MOTEL, HELL'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     A TAXI pulls over in front of this flea-bag motel.  Max gets
     out with a SUITCASE, looks at the dubious accommodations.

     INT.  MOTEL, MAX'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Max enters with Welles, turns on a light and throws his
     suitcase on the bed.  The room is disgusting.

                             MAX
                 You didn't say it was gonna be this
                 luxurious.

                             WELLES
                 It's their Presidential Suite.

                             MAX
                 Great.

     Max looks in the bathroom.

                             MAX
                 Oh, come on, man, what are we doing
                 in this flea bag?

                             WELLES
                 It's cheap, and people know to mind
                 their own business. What have you
                 got for me? 

     Max opens his suitcase, takes out THREE VIDEO TAPES.

     He hands them to Welles.  The boxes are covered in jumbled
     PHOTO COLLAGES: American flag, S+M men and women, a skull,
     mannequins, a scorpion, cut-outs of arms, legs and eyeballs.

                             MAX
                 Dino Velvet.

     INT.  WELLES' MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles is lit by the flicker from the TELEVISION SCREEN.  WE
     SEE NOTHING.  We HEAR the rhythmic MUFFLED MOANS of a WOMAN
     from the TV, can't tell if it's pleasure or pain.

     Max is asleep in the bed, PIZZA BOX near his feet.

     Welles drinks beer, gets up and ejects the CASSETTE from a
     VCR, tosses it aside, tired.  He picks another Dino Velvet
     TAPE, puts it in, sits.

     ON TV: GOTHIC ROCK is HEARD over old, scratchy IMAGES: of
     Klansmen around a burning cross... Dracula menacing a
     sleeping woman... a man in a Devil costume dancing...

     Welles opens another beer.

     ON TV: a WOMAN is tied up, arms in the air, hanging from the
     ceiling, gagged and blindfolded, in a dungeon lit by
     candelabras.  Then, glimpsed IMAGES: worms writhing in
     slime... gargoyles... a guillotine falling.  Then, the bound
     woman, struggling.  A MASKED MAN in a leather jacket enters.
     He wears a LEATHER MASK with zipper eyes and mouth...

     This focuses Welles' attention.

     ON TV: the Masked Man circles the captured woman...

                             WELLES
                 Max... wake up...

     Max awakens, rolling over, groggy.

                             MAX
                 Wha... ?

                             WELLES
                       (points at TV)
                 Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?

     Max tries to see, eyes barely open.

                             MAX
                 He's one of the lunatics Dino uses.
                 He's in a bunch of these.

     Welles watches.  On the TV, Masked Man takes off his jacket
     shirtless, reveals an impossibly muscled body.  Huge arms,
     thick chest, oiled, dotted in pimples. 

                             MAX
                 Why?  He have something to do with
                 whatever you're into?

     Still watching the behemoth on TV, Welles is less sure.

     ON TV: the bulging Masked Man flexes, ripped.

                             WELLES
                 No... it's nothing... that's not him.

     Welles rubs his eyes, sits back.  Max sits up, watching.

     ON TV: Masked Man pulls the bound woman's head back by her
     hair, licks her face with his thick tongue...

     CLOSE ON: Masked Man grips the woman's head, still licking.
     He pulls down the woman's blindfold...

     Welles sits forward, realizing, horrified...

     Welles goes to the VCR, hits PAUSE.  The IMAGE on TV
     FREEZES.  Welles goes back, FRAME by FRAME...

     ... to the CLOSE UP where Masked Man grips the woman's face.
     FREEZE FRAME.  On Masked Man's hand: a TATTOO, on the arch
     between his forefinger and thumb, same as the scrawny Masked
     Man in the snuff film.  A PENTAGRAM TATTOO.

                             WELLES
                 Who is he?

                             MAX
                 I told you, he's one of Dino
                 Velvet's stock players...

                             WELLES
                 Who is he, his <u>name</u>?

                             MAX
                 Nobody knows his name.  That's his
                 thing.  He always wears a mask.  You
                 never see his face.  He calls
                 himself "Machine," that's what they
                 call him.  Machine. 

     Welles hits PLAY.  On TV, Masked Man runs his hands up and
     down the woman's body.  The woman's eyes are filled with
     fear.  Welles sits, unnerved, watching.

                             MAX
                 They say he's half brain-dead from
                 all the steroids he's using.

     Max rolls over, trying to get back to sleep.

                             MAX
                 He's a brutal motherfucker, man.  He
                 loves what he does for a living. 


     INT.  WELLES' MOTEL ROOM -- DAY

     Welles enters, carries an OVERNIGHT PACKAGE and his LOCK
     BOX.  At the desk, he tears open the package, opens the
     MANILA ENVELOPE inside; finds FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS in
     thousand dollar bills, wrapped in plastic and masking tape.

     Welles takes the lock box to the bed and works the
     combination, opens it.  He takes out the holster, stands
     looking down at the gun.  He puts the holster on.


     EXT.  1204 WAREHOUSE -- DAY

     Welles' Ford waits with turn signal on.  A car pulls out of
     a parking space.  Welles takes the space.

     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- DAY

     Max is in the passenger seat.  Welles looks to 1204.

                             WELLES
                 You don't need to be here.

                             MAX
                 What kind of Junior P.I. would I be
                 if I didn't go with you?

     INT.  1204 WAREHOUSE, SECOND FLOOR -- DAY

     Welles and Max get off the elevator, moving down the grey
     hall, to the black doors.  Welles pushes the INTERCOM
     BUTTON.  After a moment, the INTERCOM CRACKLES...

                             MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                       (from intercom)
                 Who is it?

     Welles waits, presses the button again.

     INT.  DINO VELVET STUDIO -- DAY

     The doors BUZZ and Welles and Max warily enter this large,
     dark, converted warehouse.  Square pillars shoot from floor
     to ceiling.  Shafts of light cut down from high windows.

     A large THUG in a pinstripe suit crosses from a far DESK.

                             THUG
                 You're in the wrong place.

                             WELLES
                 We're looking for Mr. Velvet.

                             THUG
                 He's not here. 

     Welles looks around, at piles of PROPS; a huge faux-stone
     ANGEL and GARGOYLES, elaborate CANDELABRAS, a huge BIRDCAGE,
     massive WOODEN CROSS, NAZI FLAGS.

                             WELLES
                 Why don't you tell him we're here to
                 give him a large sum of money.  If
                 he's not interested, we'll go.

                             THUG
                 You should leave now, before I have
                 to remove you.

     Welles just stands looking at the thug.  A VOICE is HEARD...

                             DINO VELVET'S VOICE (V.O.)
                       (from SPEAKERS)
                 Show them in, Milo.

     Welles and Max look up.  There are SPEAKERS mounted high up
     on the pillars, and SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS looking down.

                             WELLES
                 You heard the boss, Milo.

     The disgruntled thug starts back across the studio towards
     a distant DOOR.  Welles and Max follow...

     They notice an elaborate set built in one corner, a TORTURE
     CHAMBER, complete with RACK and IRON MAIDEN.

     INT.  DINO VELVET'S OFFICE -- DAY

     Thug opens the door and lets Welles and Max in.
     The office is huge, windowless walls covered in thousands of
     PICTURES from every conceivable source, torn and cut, pinned
     up to form an indecipherable collage.  A tall LADDER leans
     against one wall, near three TELEVISIONS.

     DINO VELVET rises behind his desk, a small, bird-like man,
     wearing a black suit and bad hairpiece.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Come in.  Make yourself comfortable.

     Welles shakes Dino's hand.  Max looks up at the walls.
     IMAGES; porn pictures, news photos, world leaders, autopsy
     photos, armies and insects, the naked and the dead.

                             WELLES
                 It's an honor to meet you.  Thank
                 you for seeing us.

                             DINO VELVET
                 What can I do for you today?

     Welles sits.  Shelves behind Dino's desk are piled high with
     VIDEO CASSETTES, old MOVIE CAMERAS, big REELS of 16mm FILM.
     VIDEOS and MAGAZINES are stacked everywhere.

                             WELLES
                 I'd like to commission a work.  I'm
                 a great admirer of yours.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Flattering.  And, who's your
                 colorful little chum?

                             WELLES
                 A fellow investor.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Hmm.

                             MAX
                 You're the only one still shooting
                 film and transferring it to video.
                 Nobody appreciates that kind of
                 integrity anymore... the grain, the
                 gritty look you get.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Well, I'm glad you appreciate it.
                       (to Welles)
                 What would you say is your favorite
                 piece?

     Welles considers.  Max glances over, looks back to the walls.

                             MAX
                 I know if I had to pick, it'd be
                 "Choke," or "Devil."

                             WELLES
                 "Devil" frightened me as much as it
                 excited me, but I'd be hard pressed
                 to choose a favorite.

     Dino grins, showing yellowed teeth.

                             DINO VELVET
                 You said something about money.

                             WELLES
                 Yes.  What we're looking for is
                 rather specific.

     Welles takes out an ENVELOPE, puts it on the desk.

                             WELLES
                 That's five thousand dollars.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Is it?

                             WELLES
                 Five thousand now, five thousand on
                 delivery. 
                 Two women, one white and one black,
                 as long as they have large breasts.
                 Hard bondage, or course.  Other than
                 that, trusting your artistic
                 interpretation, I have only two
                 stipulations.

                             DINO VELVET
                 And they are?

                             WELLES
                 I want to watch you work.

                             DINO VELVET
                 I'll consider it.

                             WELLES
                 And the other performer... it has to
                 be that monster you use... the man
                 in the mask.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Machine.

                             WELLES
                 If it's not him, there's no deal.

     Dino drums his painted fingernails on his lips.

                             DINO VELVET
                 He might be interested... but it
                 would mean another five thousand.

                             WELLES
                 We can do that.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Well, well, I'll have to put my
                 thinking-cap on about all this.
                 You'll leave the money as a deposit?
                       (off Welles' nod)
                 Very good.

     Dino stands, picks up a still CAMERA off his desk and comes
     to look at Welles, studying him.

                             DINO VELVET
                 You have a beautiful face... the way
                 the light hits it.  I'd like to take
                 your picture.  You don't mind?

                             WELLES
                 I'd rather you didn't.

                             DINO VELVET
                 What's the problem? 

                             WELLES
                 I'm camera shy.

                             DINO VELVET
                 You trust me to keep your money, but
                 not to take your picture?

                             WELLES
                 Those are two different kinds of
                 trust.
                       (stands)
                 Thank you for your time.  I hope we
                 can do business.

     Welles leaves.  Max goes with him.  Dino watches them leave.


     EXT.  MANHATTAN STREET -- NIGHT

     HORNS BLARE.  TWO CARS have collided head-on.  A large CROWD
     gathers.  One windshield's shattered, blood spattered.  The
     driver is slumped over the wheel, gushing blood.

     On a nearby street corner, Welles in on a PAY PHONE.
     HEAVY METAL can be HEARD filtered through the receiver.

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 So, what do you say?

     INT.  DINO VELVET'S OFFICE -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

     Dino's stands in the middle of his office, naked, his back
     to us, 8MM camera in hand, on the phone.  A NAKED WOMAN
     dances for Dino.  A Heavy Metal MUSIC VIDEO plays on a TV.

                             DINO VELVET
                       (into phone)
                 I'll do this for you.  Fifteen
                 thousand dollars.

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Machine's in?

                             DINO VELVET
                       (into phone)
                 He's in.  It will be his pleasure.

     INT.  PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

                             DINO VELVET (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Be at 366 Hoyt Avenue, three
                 o'clock, tomorrow.

     Welles digs out his notepad, writing. 

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Where's that?

                             DINO VELVET (V.O.)
                 Brooklyn.  Don't be late.


     EXT.  MOTEL COURTYARD, POOL -- NIGHT

     HORNS and TRAFFIC are HEARD.  Max and Welles sit in lawn
     chairs at the tiny pool.  Welles smokes.  Max drinks beer.
     They watch an ELDERLY WOMAN in a one piece bathing suit
     climb from the pool and walk to the diving board, diving in.

                             MAX
                 What's next?

                             WELLES
                 I'm trying to figure that out
                 myself.  I have to see Machine
                 without his mask.

                             MAX
                 Still don't want to tell me what
                 you're doing?

                             WELLES
                 Nope.

     The old woman climbs out and heads back to the diving board.
     Welles takes out a thick ENVELOPE, hands it to Max.

                             WELLES
                 This is for you.

     Max doesn't understand, opens the envelope, finds about
     fifteen thousand dollars in the envelope.

                             MAX
                 What's this?

                             WELLES
                 It's money.  People use it to
                 purchase goods and services.

     Max looks at it again, can't believe it.

                             MAX
                 Look... that's awful generous and
                 everything...

                             WELLES
                 It's not my money.  The woman I got
                 it from is never going to give it a
                 second thought.  Let's not make a
                 big deal out of this, okay? 
                       (pause)
                 Go be a race car driver.  Go run for
                 President.  Whatever.

     Welles puts his cigarette out, stands.

                             WELLES
                 I'll see you around.

     Welles walks away, heading to his room.  Max watches him go,
     doesn't know what to say, looks in the envelope.

     The old woman climbs out and heads back to the diving board.


     EXT.  BROOKLYN STREETS -- DAY

     A deserted, war zone neighborhood of abandoned, graffittied
     buildings.  A few burnt out cars on the street.  Welles
     drives through, watchful.

     Welles drives past a huge TWO-STORY WAREHOUSE, does a u-turn.
     He parks the car.

     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- DAY

     Welles checks his gun, returns it to his holster.

     EXT.  BROOKLYN WAREHOUSE -- DAY

     Welles climbs crumbling concrete stairs, looking all
     directions, crossing a LOADING DOCK towards a DOOR...

     INT.  BROOKLYN WAREHOUSE -- DAY

     Welles enters slowly, trying to get his eyes to adjust to
     the darkness.  A vast, empty space looms before him.

     In the middle of the warehouse, Dino Velvet stands, in a
     powder blue suit, holding an archery BOW and ARROW.

                             DINO VELVET
                 There you are.  Come join us.

     There's a wrought IRON BED not far from Dino.  MACHINE is
     seated on the mattress, a huge man, wearing a leather S+M
     harness and the same WRESTLING MASK as in the snuff film.

     Welles gathers his courage, walks towards them.

     Dino pulls back on the bow, aiming away across the
     warehouse.  He stands by a TABLE with a QUIVER of ARROWS
     propped up.  He shoots an arrow toward a large TARGET...

     Strikes the target dead center, BULL'S-EYE.  As Welles gets
     closer, he notices several things ... 

     ... a 16MM CAMERA mounted on a TRIPOD, facing the bed, along
     with several movie LIGHTS

     ... several BOWIE KNIFES are laid out on the table, beside
     a pair of HANDCUFFS...

     ... Machine is watching him as he approaches...

     Welles stops, not far from Dino and Machine, but keeping his
     distance.  Dino's still firing arrows at the target.
     Machine's still staring at Welles.

                             WELLES
                       (to Machine)
                 Hello.

     Machine just stares at him with bloodshot eyes.

                             DINO VELVET
                 You brought the money?

                             WELLES
                       (takes out envelope)
                 Right here.

     Dino lets fly another arrow... another bull's-eye, then
     turns to look at Welles with a smile.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Excellent.

                             WELLES
                 Where are the women?

                             DINO VELVET
                 They should be here any minute.

     Welles comes forward slowly, places the envelope on the
     table, beside Bowie knifes.  He's sweating.

                             WELLES
                       (of the knifes)
                 What are these for?

                             DINO VELVET
                 Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just
                 props.  Nice, aren't they?

                             WELLES
                 Sure.

     Dino walks across towards the target.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Machine and I were just talking
                 about knifes.  The beauty of
                 knifes...

     Dino pulls arrows from the target.

                             DINO VELVET
                 He was saying how fascinated he is
                 by their simple ability to be sharp.
                 The ability of a piece of metal to
                 be so thin that it is almost
                 nothing...

     Dino walks back to the table, replaces the arrows in the
     quiver, cueing another arrow in is bow.

                             DINO VELVET
                 So close to nothingness that it cuts
                 with minimum effort, because it's so
                 non-intrusive.  Flesh is fooled.  It
                 blooms open as the blade widens, but
                 by then it's too late, because the
                 knife's already doing its pure,
                 simple damage.

     Dino shoots another arrow to the target.
     A CLATTER attracts Welles attention.  Far across the
     warehouse, a DELIVERY DOOR rolls upwards.  A CAR with tinted
     windows drives in...

     The MAN who opened the door, silhouetted in sunlight, stays
     behind to close the door as the car pulls forward...

                             DINO VELVET
                 Ah, ours guests have arrived.

     Machine stands.  He is a giant.
     Welles takes a few steps back, wary, sweating hard now.

     The car parks across the warehouse, not far from the target.

     Dino puts another arrow in his bow, pulls it taunt, aims at
     the target... turns, aims the arrow at Welles.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Mister Welles... would you be so
                 kind as to remove any firearms from
                 your person?

                             WELLES
                 What are you... ?

                             DINO VELVET
                 Take out your gun!

     Welles brings his hand towards his holster...

                             DINO VELVET
                 Slowly.  Let me see it.

     Welles takes out his gun, looks across the warehouse...

     The SILHOUETTED MAN is walking this way.  Can't tell who he
     is yet.  Machine heads the direction of the parked car.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Empty the gun onto the table, very
                 carefully.

                             WELLES
                 Look, I don't know what this...

                             DINO VELVET
                 Shut up, cunt!  Do exactly as I say,
                 or I'll put this arrow through your
                 throat.

     Welles obeys, helpless, dumps the bullets out on the table.

     The SILHOUETTED MAN'S getting closer.  It's Eddie Poole.

                             EDDIE
                 Is that him?

                             DINO VELVET
                       (to Welles)
                 Put the gun down, take the
                 handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the
                 bed.

     Welles obeys, walks to the bed.
     Welles attaches one cuff to the bed's iron rail, fastens the
     other cuff around his wrist. Dino puts down the bow and arrow.

                             DINO VELVET
                       (still to Welles)
                 Didn't know what to make of you at
                 first, and you certainly had Eddie
                 on pins and needles.  But, lo and
                 behold, from out of the blue came an
                 old business acquaintance to explain
                 everything...

     Welles looks across to the car...
     The sinister lawyer, Longdale, gets out from behind the
     wheel and hands the keys to Machine, walks this way...

                             EDDIE
                 This is the fucker?  Motherfucker,
                 doesn't look like anything...

     Eddie walks around the bed, studies Welles.  Welles watches
     him.  Eddie goes to stand behind Welles, rushes forward...

     PUNCHES Welles in the side of the head.
     Welles goes down, clutching his face.

                             EDDIE
                 Doesn't look like shit.

     Eddie pulls Welles to his feet, throws him against the bed,
     frisking him from head to toe.

     Longdale comes to stand beside Dino, nervous, taking out a
     tiny HANDGUN and pointing it at Welles.  Welles looks up,
     holding his head, afraid, sits on the bed.

                             DINO VELVET
                     (to Welles)
                 You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?

                             WELLES
                 I remember him.

                             LONGDALE
                 Let's get this over with.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Fine idea.

     Dino comes to sit on the bed beside Welles.

                             DINO VELVET
                 You're going to go get the film you
                 received from Mrs. Christian, bring
                 it here and put it in my hand.  And
                 to save time, so we make this as
                 efficient as possible, there's an
                 incentive...

     Dino puts his fingers in his mouth, lets out a sharp WHISTLE.

     Across the warehouse, Machine uses the car keys to open the
     trunk of the car, pulls SOMEONE out...

     It's Max, beaten bloody, bound, face swollen, gagged, hardly
     conscious.  Machine throws him to the floor.

                             WELLES
                 No...

     Welles tries to go towards Max, yanked back by the
     handcuffs, pulls the bed a few inches, but it's heavy.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Friend of yours?

                             WELLES
                 Look, he's got nothing to do with
                 this... let him go...

                             DINO VELVET
                 Can you guess what I'm going to say
                 next?

                             WELLES
                 He doesn't know anything... he's got
                 nothing to do with this...

                             DINO VELVET
                 Bring the film, or we kill him.

     Sorrow and rage rises up in Welles, but there's no choice.

                             WELLES
                 I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit
                 box, in the city...

                             DINO VELVET
                 How cooperative.  Longdale will keep
                 you company.

     Dino takes out HANDCUFF KEYS, throws them to Longdale.
     Longdale approaches Welles carefully, unlocking him.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Don't let Longdale's questionable
                 choice of weapon give you any ideas.
                 If his fey little gun puts enough
                 little holes in you, you'll be just
                 as dead... and so will Max.

                             EDDIE
                 Move it, dirtbag... !

     Eddie comes to SHOVE Welles.  Welles stumbles to the
     ground, gets to his feet.  Welles walks, takes one last
     glance back towards Max.  Longdale follows.

                             DINO VELVET
                       (watching them go)
                 Do hurry.


     EXT.  MANHATTAN STREETS -- DAY

     Welles' car moves in the slow flow of traffic into mid-town.

     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- CONTINUOUS

     Welles is at the wheel.  Longdale is in the passenger seat,
     gun held in his lap.

                             WELLES
                 You were the middleman, am I right?
                 Old man Christian wasn't about to go
                 shopping for a snuff film himself.

                             LONGDALE
                 Wouldn't exactly have been possible
                 for a man of his stature.

                             WELLES
                 So, he sent you, gave you the money,
                 his errand-boy.  And if you refused,
                 it wasn't like you could tell anyone
                 your pervert boss just asked you to
                 get him a snuff film.  That's the
                 beauty of lawyer/client privilege.

                             LONGDALE
                 That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted
                 me implicitly.

                             WELLES
                 Must have paid you a lot, for you to
                 risk everything.  Would've had to
                 have cut yourself a real nice piece
                 of money.

                             LONGDALE
                 I was well compensated.

                             WELLES
                 That's why you got scared when Mrs.
                 Christian hired me.  You knew about
                 the film, figured it had to be in
                 that safe.  How'd you find me?

                             LONGDALE
                 Never mind how I found you.

                             WELLES
                 Followed me... must have freaked out
                 when you saw me closing in on your
                 buddies...

                             LONGDALE
                 They're no friends of mine.

                             WELLES
                 Except, you're willing commit murder
                 with them.

                             LONGDALE
                 None of this would be happening if
                 you would have left it alone.  If
                 you weren't digging up a girl who
                 died six years ago.  A girl no one
                 even remembers.

                             WELLES
                 Mary Anne Mathews, that was her
                 name.  Her mom remembers her.

     Welles looks at Longdale.

                             WELLES
                 You found these smut dealers and
                 asked to buy a snuff film, right?
                 Wanted them to find you one.  Well,
                 they didn't <u>find</u> you one, Longdale,
                 they went out and <u>made</u> you one...

                             LONGDALE
                 Shut up.

                             WELLES
                 Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you
                 paid money to have her murdered.

                             LONGDALE
                 Shut your mouth and drive!

                             WELLES
                 Did it get him off, huh, watching
                 them cut her up?  Tell me, because
                 I really want to understand.  Did he
                 jerk off to it?  You watch it with
                 him, sit there giving him a handjob
                 while you both watched... ?

     Longdale jams the gun against Welles' side.

                             LONGDALE 
                 You're making me very angry.

                             WELLES
                 Just tell me.  Tell me some more of
                 the secrets you and Christian
                 shared. What kind of degenerate
                 pervert was he really?  What the
                 fuck did he want with a snuff film?

                             LONGDALE
                 You're asking me why?

                             WELLES
                 I'm asking.

     Longdale sits back, wipes sweat from his face.

                             LONGDALE
                 A man like Mr. Christian, a great
                 man... all his money, all his
                 power... a man who attained
                 everything there was to attain...

                             WELLES
                 Why did he buy a film of some poor,
                 lost girl getting butchered?

                             LONGDALE
                 Isn't it incredibly obvious?

                             WELLES
                 Enlighten me.

                             LONGDALE
                 Because he could.  He did it because
                 he could.
                       (pause)
                 What other reason were you looking
                 for?

     Welles tightens his grip on the wheel, numbed. 


     EXT.  CHASE MANHATTAN BANK -- DAY

     Welles double parks, puts his hazard lights on.

     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- CONTINUOUS

     Longdale sits forward, looks to the bank.

                             LONGDALE
                 You've got four minutes till I call
                 Mr. Velvet and let him know there's
                 a problem.

     Longdale takes a CELLULAR PHONE from his pocket, shows it.
     Welles climbs out, heading to the bank...

     INT.  BANK, SAFE DEPOSIT VAULT -- DAY

     Welles and the SAFE DEPOSIT MANAGER enter.  They go to put
     their KEYS in one drawer, unlocking it a pulling it out.

                             MANAGER
                 May I show you to a booth...

                             WELLES
                 No, I've got it.

     Welles pulls the drawer open, takes the 8MM film out and
     hands the empty drawer to the manager, exiting.

     INT.  BANK -- DAY

     Welles comes out from the SAFE DEPOSIT VAULT, pocketing the
     film, crossing towards the entrance, looking around...

     ... at other CUSTOMERS waiting on line...

     ... at a GUARD with a GUN at his side...

     Welles detours, toward one of the LOAN DESKS.  The BANK
     EMPLOYEE behind the desk is occupied, on the phone.

     As Welles moves past the desk, he grabs a PAIR of SCISSORS
     from a pencil holder and palms it, heading to the door...

     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- DAY

     Welles gets behind the wheel.  Longdale looks at his watch.

                             LONGDALE
                 You almost went over your limit.

                             WELLES
                 Fuck you.

     Welles puts the car in gear and drives. 

                             LONGDALE
                 Give me the film.

                             WELLES 
                 You'll get it when we get there.

     Longdale puts the gun to the side of Welles' head.

                             LONGDALE
                 Give me the film.

                             WELLES
                 Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try
                 driving to Brooklyn with my brains
                 all over the windshield.

     Welles keeps driving.  Longdale sits back, stewing.


     INT.  WAREHOUSE -- DAY

     The door is kicked open.  Welles enters, takes the 8MM FILM
     out and holds it in his hand.  Longdale follows.

     As Welles moves forward, his face goes slack...

     Machine is seated on the bed, Eddie and Dino stand smoking
     cigarettes, and further on, <u>Max is tied to the target,</u>
     <u>slumped over, three arrows in his chest</u>.  Dead.

                             WELLES
                 No!!

     Welles runs towards Max, crying out, tears in his eyes...

     Machine rises, goes to intercept Welles, grabbing him.
     Welles tries to break free, but Machine lifts Welles up and
     throws him brutally to the ground.

     Welles scrambles to get up...

                             WELLES
                 You fuckers!

     Eddie comes to KICK Welles in the face.
     Welles is sent sprawling, blood gushing from his nose.  He
     lays there, stunned, weeping.

     Eddie pries the 8MM FILM from Welles' hand, tosses it...

     Dino catches the film.

     Machine comes to drag Welles towards the bed.

     Dino unspools the film, holding it up to examine it.

     Machine handcuffs Welles to the metal bedframe.  Welles
     falls to his knees, holding his face.
     Eddie PUNCHES Welles in the head.

                             EDDIE
                 You're a dead man.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Leave him alone.

                             EDDIE
                 Fuck off.

     Eddie PUNCHES Welles in the kidney.  Welles tries to protect
     himself.  Eddie raises his fist to punch again, but Machine
     catches Eddie's fist, throws Eddie back...

                             EDDIE
                 What the fuck... !

                             DINO
                 I promised him to Machine.

     Eddie looks up at Machine, who towers over him.

                             EDDIE
                 ... sorry...

                             DINO VELVET
                 First things first.  You might want
                 to watch this, Mr. Welles...

     Welles looks up through tears...
     Dino drops the 8MM FILM on the floor, takes a small bottle
     of lighter fluid from his pocket.  Longdale comes to watch.

     Welles watches helpless, agonizing...

                             WELLES
                 Don't... please...

     Dino drops the film to the floor, sprays it with fluid,
     takes out matches, light one, drops it...

     The 8MM FILM goes up in flame...

     Welles watches, quaking, hysterical, trying to pull himself
     towards the flame, dragging the bed...

     The film is destroyed by flame...

     Welles gives up, presses his face to the floor, eyes shut.

                             DINO VELVET
                 And so it ends.  It's as if she
                 never existed.

     Welles falls back, gasping, wiping blood and tears and
     spittle from his face, getting slowly, to his feet.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Don't blame yourself.  You were in
                 way over your head.

     He looks to Max's corpse, to the smoldering film...
     Swallowing back his fear, panic and rage...

                             WELLES
                 Motherfuckers.  Small time,
                 motherfuckers... !  Tell me
                 something...

     Welles spits blood, hangs onto the bed for support.

                             WELLES
                 I know why you did it, Dino,
                 Eddie... but, why'd the lawyer do
                 it?  Must have been a helluva lot of
                 money, right?  One fuckload of
                 money...

     Welles sits on the bed, eyes burning with fury.

                             WELLES
                 So, what are you all still doing
                 small time, huh?  What are you still
                 doing in the sewer, Eddie?!
                 Christian gave Longdale a million
                 dollars to find him a snuff film.
                 How much did you ever see... ?

     Eddie and Dino look to Longdale.

                             EDDIE
                 What's he talking about?

                             WELLES
                 One million dollars, Dino.  How much
                 did he tell you he had...

     Longdale's getting very nervous.

                             LONGDALE
                 He's lying.

                             WELLES
                 Look at him.  You think he played it
                 square?  How much did he give you,
                 how much did he keep for himself?

     Eddie walks towards Longdale...

                             EDDIE
                 What the fuck's he talking about?

     Longdale takes out his gun, aims it at Machine, Dino and
     Eddie, scared...

                             LONGDALE
                 Stay away from me. 

                             DINO VELVET
                 What's going on, Longdale?  Did this
                 happen?

                             EDDIE
                 You sell us short, you fuck?

                             LONGDALE
                 Stay back!  You have a gun, Eddie,
                 show it to me.  Now!

     Eddie slowly takes out his gun, seething.

                             LONGDALE
                 Put it on the ground, kick it here...

     Eddie puts the gun down, kicks it...
     Longdale picks it up, throws it far away.

                             EDDIE
                 You fucking lawyer...

                             LONGDALE
                 Move back!  All of you... move!

     Machine, Dino and Eddie stand between Longdale and the car
     with tinted windows parked across the warehouse...

                             DINO VELVET
                 What were you thinking?

     Welles watches as Machine, Dino and Eddie back slowly away
     from Longdale.  Longdale's gun hand is shaky...

     Welles tries to drag himself towards the table where his gun
     and bullets are, dragging the bed, inch by inch...

     Longdale back away, trying to angle around the menacing trio
     so he can get to the car...

                             LONGDALE
                 Back off!  Everything's been taken
                 care of, and I'm leaving now...

                             DINO VELVET
                 You're not going anywhere if you
                 fucked us, lawyer.

                             LONGDALE
                 I'm leaving.

                             EDDIE
                 You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna
                 kill us all, is that it?

                             DINO VELVET
                 You betrayed us.

                             LONGDALE
                 Stay where you are!

     Machine edges forward, holding his hands in the air.
     Longdale brandishes the gun...

                             LONGDALE
                 Keep back!

     Machine, Eddie and Dino are held at bay...

                             DINO VELVET
                 You're not gonna live through this.

     Welles still tries to get to the table, wrist bleeding in
     the cuff, bed screeching across the floor...

     Machine, hands up, slowly reaches behind his shoulder,
     touches the handle of a huge KNIFE sheathed to his back.

                             LONGDALE
                 Our business is done, I'm leaving,
                 no one's going to stop me...

     Longdale glances towards the car, seems like he's about to
     make a run for it.  Dino Velvet takes a step forward...

                             DINO VELVET
                 Fuck you!

     Machine unsheathes the KNIFE and THROWS...

     THUNK!  The knife imbeds to the hilt in Longdale's chest and
     Longdale's gun FIRES...

     Dino Velvet flies backwards, shot in the face!

     Dino hits the ground, screaming, writhing, hands to his
     face, blood pouring out between his fingers.

     Longdale falls back onto his ass, sitting there, eyes bugged
     out in surprise.  He looks down at the knife in his chest.

     Machine lets out a SCREAM, runs to Dino...

     Machine falls to his knees and grips Dino, tries to hold
     him.  Dino's screaming, squirming frantically...

     Longdale sits looking down at the knife in his chest, looks
     up, and gallons of blood pour from his mouth...

                             EDDIE
                 Fuck.

     Eddie comes to look down at the Longdale.  Longdale falls
     back, dead, blood still flowing from his maw.

     Welles drags the heavy bed, getting closer to the table...

     Eddie spins, looks across to see Welles struggling...

     Dino breaks free from Machine, runs blindly, still holding
     his gushing face, falls, tries to get back up...

     Eddie runs towards Welles.

     Dino stumbles forwards, writhing, then suddenly lays still.

     Machine rises, looking at Dino.  Tears come out from
     Machine's eyes and roll down his mask.

     One last gasp and shudder from Dino's body; death rattle.

     Welles pulls the bed, practically pulling his arm from the
     socket, desperately clawing towards the table...
     The table is mere feet away...

     Eddie arrives, KICK Welles in the ribs...

     Welles recoils.  Eddies KICKS again.  Welles curls into a
     ball.  Eddie KICKS again...

                             MACHINE (O.S.)
                 NO!

     Eddie stops, looks to Machine.

                             MACHINE
                 He's mine!

     Machine strides over the Longdale's corpse, puts his foot on
     Longdale's chest, yanks out the knife...
     Machine starts this way...

     Eddie backs from Welles.  Welles looks up, trying to shake
     off unconsciousness, sees Machine coming...

     Welles bows down, on his knees, as if to accept his fate...
     Reaching his free hand into his suit pocket...

                             WELLES
                 No, no, no... please, don't kill
                 me... please... !

     Machine arrives, knife in hand, lifts Welles' head back by
     the hair, brings the knife hand back...

                             EDDIE
                 Do him good.

     Welles rises suddenly, arm shooting forward, STABBING
     SCISSORS deep in Machine stomach...

     Machine ROARS, falling back, pitching forward...

     Machine's knife clatters to the ground.

     Eddie's eyes go wide. 

     Machine hits the floor, clutching his guts.

     Welles pushes upwards with all he's got left, turns the iron
     bedframe onto its side, flipping the mattress off...

     Eddie moves forward, furious...

     Welles grabs Machine's knife, wielding it, holding Eddie off.

                             WELLES
                 Back off, Eddie...

     Welles drags the now lightened bed frame towards the table.
     Eddie's sorely tempted, but keeps away.

     Eddie turns, looks across the warehouse...

     There's his gun, lying there, far away.

     Eddie runs for the gun.

     Welles pulls himself to the table, reaches for the gun,
     knocks the table over.  He's got the gun, but...

     Bullets hit the floor as the table falls.

     Welles struggles to open his gun with his sole free hand,
     gets it open, holds it between his knees...

     Welles grabs a bullet...

     Eddie's running toward his gun, gasping for air...

     Machine's on his knees, pulling the scissors out with
     trembling hands...

     Welles puts the bullet in the gun, flips it shut, rises,
     taking aim across the warehouse...

                             WELLES
                 Stop Eddie!

     Eddie's running...

                             WELLES
                       (pulls back the hammer)
                 I swear to Christ I'll shoot you in
                 the back... !

     Eddie stops, hands up, about ten feet from his gun...

     Machine stays on his knees, holding his bleeding stomach.
     Welles points his gun at Machine.

                             WELLES
                 Come back, or I put a hole in him.

     Eddie's looking at his gun, so close, so far away.

                             WELLES
                 You might make it to your gun, but
                 not before I shoot Machine.  And if
                 I have to shoot him because of you,
                 and I don't kill him, right after he
                 kills me, he's gonna kill you.

     Eddie turns, starts walking back...

                             WELLES
                       (to Machine)
                 Take off the mask.

     Machine shakes his head.

                             WELLES
                 Take it off!

                             MACHINE
                 You got one bullet.

     Welles looks to see Eddie heading back, keeps the gun on
     Machine, backs away, dragging the bed frame, looks to the
     DOOR behind him...

                             MACHINE
                 The only choice you have now, is
                 which one of us kills you.

     Welles backs away, drags the bedframe.  Eddie's getting
     close.  Welles points the gun at Eddie.  Eddie slows.

     Welles points the gun at Machine, points the gun at Eddie.

     Welles puts the gun to the chain of his handcuffs, FIRES...
     breaks the handcuff chain.

     Welles bolts to the door...

                             MACHINE
                 Get the gun!

     Eddie runs back towards his gun.
     Machine rises with a grunt of pain, moves towards the door,
     but agony doubles him back over to his knees.

     EXT.  BROOKLYN WAREHOUSE -- DAY

     Welles shoves out into daylight, fleeing down the stairs,
     running towards his car...

     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY

     Welles climbs in, gets out his keys, starts the car...
     He pulls away, TIRES SCREECHING.  Behind, Eddie gives chase,

     Welles ducks as BULLETS SLAM the car, SHATTERING WINDOWS.

     EXT.  BROOKLYN STREETS -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY

     Welles' car picks up speed, takes a turn, BURNING RUBBER...

     Welles' car races away.


     INT.  WELLES' HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     Amy looks tired, like she hasn't slept.  She feeds Cindy.

     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY

     Welles drives, face caked in dried blood, cellular phone to

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)

     EXT.  HIGHWAY -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY

     Welles' car tears down the freeway, passing other cars.


     EXT.  WELLES' NEIGHBORHOOD -- NIGHT

     Suburban streets.  Welles' car arrives, parks.  Welles gets
     out, starts across a neighbor's yard, cuts between houses...

     EXT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BACKYARD -- NIGHT

     Welles enters his backyard, slowing, taking out his gun.  He
     keeps behind shrubbery, surveying his dark house.

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, DOWNSTAIRS LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles uses a key to unlock the SLIDING GLASS DOOR, opens it
     slow, enters, gun up, searching the darkness.

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, OFFICE -- NIGHT

     Welles pushes the door open, checks this room.

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles makes sure the bedroom's empty, looks in the
     bathroom.  He puts his gun away, leaves the lights off.

     He goes to the PHONE on the bedside table, unscrews the
     earpiece.  He removes a small, wire-mesh BUGGING DEVICE.

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Dark.  Welles picks up the cordless phone, struggles to pry
     the receiver open.  He discovers another small BUG.

     He drops the BUGS to the floor, crushes them under foot.

     He puts the phone back together and is replacing it when it
     RINGS LOUDLY.  Welles is startled, drops the phone...

     Welles takes a breath, trying to shake off the jitters.  He
     picks up the RINGING PHONE, answers it...

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Honey... ?

                             MACHINE (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Not quite.

     Welles stiffens.

                             MACHINE (V.O.)
                 Nothing like getting home after a
                 rough day.  Home sweet home.

     Welles moves into the HALL, towards the front door...

                             MACHINE (V.O.)
                 Walk away.  Pack your bags, put the
                 wife and kid in the car and find a
                 place to hide.  If you're lucky,
                 you'll never see me again.

     Welles takes out his gun, opens the front door, looking out.
     The street in front of the house is empty.  CRICKETS CHIRP.

                             WELLES
                 I don't know if I can do that.

                             MACHINE (V.O.)
                 I know who you are.  I know where
                 you live.  I know everything I need
                 to know to find you.
                       (pause)
                 Who am I?

     MACHINE is HEARD HANGING UP the phone.


     INT.  HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

     Cindy's crying.  Amy opens the door with the chain on, sees
     Welles, lets him in.  Amy and Welles embrace, kissing.  Amy
     touches Welles damaged face, worried...

                             AMY
                 What happened to you?

                             WELLES 
                 I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you
                 alright?

                             AMY
                 What's going on, Tom?  What happened?

                             WELLES
                 I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I
                 can't.  You have to trust me...

                             AMY
                 Tom...

                             WELLES 
                 It has to be this way for now.  It
                 won't be long.

     Welles goes to pick up Cindy, tries to comfort her, kisses
     her red face as she keeps crying.

                             AMY
                 Why haven't you called?  Why don't
                 you answer your phone?

                             WELLES
                 I don't know.  I'm sorry...

                             AMY
                 You're sorry?  What was I supposed
                 to think?

     Amy comes to take Cindy from him.

                             AMY
                 You owe me an explanation.  You
                 can't treat me like this.

                             WELLES
                 I wanted to call.  I couldn't.

                             AMY
                 You couldn't?

                             WELLES
                 You don't understand...

                             AMY
                 No, I don't, because you're not
                 telling me anything!

                             WELLES
                 I was in hell.  If I called you...
                 if I heard your voice... it would
                 have been so easy for me to quit.
                 I couldn't do that.

     Tears comes to Amy's eyes.

                             AMY
                 You should have.

                             WELLES
                 Amy, I'm not going to let anything
                 happen to us.

                             AMY
                 Look where we are.  Look at
                 yourself.  You son of a bitch,
                 you don't have any idea what
                 you're putting me through...

                             WELLES
                 I don't know what to say

                             AMY
                 You're killing me...

                             WELLES
                 Don't...

                             AMY
                 What was I supposed to think
                 happened to you?!

                             WELLES
                 Amy...

     Welles goes to Amy, but she pulls away.  She sits on the
     bed.  Cindy's still crying.  Welles sits beside Amy, puts
     her arms around her.

                             WELLES
                 Forgive me.

     Amy cradles Cindy.  Welles rests his head on Amy's shoulder,
     places one hand on Cindy.

                             WELLES
                 We have to stay here a few days.
                 I'll get more clothing from the
                 house if I can.  I'm sorry.
                       (pause)
                 We're going to be okay.

     Welles rises.  He goes to the PHONE, starts dialing.  Amy
     looks at him, wipes tears.

                             AMY
                 Who are you calling?

                             WELLES
                 Mrs. Christian.

                             AMY
                 What?

                             WELLES
                 She's all I've got.  She's the only
                 witness.

                             AMY
                 Tom... she's dead.

     Welles looks to Amy.

                             AMY 
                 She died in her sleep three days
                 ago.  It was in the paper...

                             WELLES
                 I just talked to her.

     Cindy's crying.  Welles sits into a chair, trying to
     understand this, his mind racing.  He hangs up the phone.

                             AMY
                 How could you not know?

     Misery pulls down the corners of Welles' mouth.  He tries to
     find words, but none come.  He sits forward and hides his
     face in his hands, overwhelmed.  Cindy's crying.


     INT.  HOTEL ROOM -- LATER NIGHT

     Cindy sleeps, encircled by pillows and blankets on the bed.
     Amy watches her, runs her hand gently across Cindy's head.

     Amy rises, turns out the light, goes to a BALCONY DOOR...

     EXT.  HOTEL ROOM, BALCONY -- NIGHT

     Welles sits with his feet up on the balcony rail, looking
     into the parking lot.  Amy joins him, sits.

                             AMY
                 Promise you'll stay.

     Welles looks at Amy.

                             WELLES
                 Promise you won't go back there,
                 wherever you were.  Whatever it was,
                 forget it.

     Welles takes a deep breath, nods his head.

                             AMY
                 Promise me.

     Welles looks out into the night sky of stars.

                             WELLES
                 I promise.

     Amy comes to kiss Welles.  Welles wraps his arms around her
     and holds her tight.  She holds him.


     INT.  HOTEL ROOM -- LATER NIGHT

     Amy is asleep on the bed beside Cindy.  Welles comes out
     from the bathroom in a fresh shirt and suit, turns off the
     bathroom light.  He stands looking at Cindy and Amy.

     EXT.  HOTEL -- NIGHT

     Welles exits the hotel, heading to his Ford.


     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- NIGHT

     Welles drives, staring ahead.  Through the windshield, the
     headlights illuminate the endless roadway.

     EXT.  KENNEDY AIRPORT -- NIGHT

     Airplanes take flight.  Manhattan glitters in the distance.


     EXT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY

     Eddie Poole's building.  A typically bright, sunny LA day.
     In the street, Welles parks a rental car, gets out.

     INT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, 8TH FLOOR HALL -- DAY

     ELEVATOR doors open and Welles gets off.  He moves down the
     hall, around a corner, heading to "<b>Celebrity Films.</b>"

     Welles tries the door knob, finds it locked.  He looks
     around, takes two steps back, KICKS forward... SMASHES the
     translucent glass of the door...

     INT.  CELEBRITY FILMS OFFICE -- DAY

     Welles pushes broken glass out of the way, reaches in to
     open the door.  The office has been cleaned out, trash on
     the floor, desk drawers hanging open and empty, shelves
     empty, posters gone...

     Welles grabs one of the file cabinets, pulls it open, finds
     it empty, pulls it all the way out and throws it.

     INT.  8TH FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY

     People peer out from other offices, worried.  Welles exits
     Eddie's office, ignoring them, goes around the corner,
     straight to the STAIRWELL, heading downstairs...


     EXT.  HOLLYWOOD HILLS -- DAY

     Welles rental car parks down the hill.  Welles climbs out,
     walking up the hill, heading for Eddie's ramshackle HOUSE.

     EXT.  EDDIE'S HOUSE, GARAGE -- DAY

     Under the stilts of the porch, Welles passes Eddie's car,
     looks in to see it loaded with BOXES and belongings.

     Welles moves on to a door at the back of the garage.  He
     takes out LOCK-PICKING TOOLS.

     INT.  EDDIE'S HOUSE, STAIRWAY -- DAY

     Welles enters slow, pockets the tools, takes out his gun.
     FOLLOW him up the stairs, into a hallway, past a LAUNDRY
     ROOM with washer and dryer, into a LIVING ROOM...

     Welles sweeps the room with his gun, wired.  Eddie's house
     is predictably a trash heap, strewn with VIDEOS, MAGAZINES,
     dirty DISHES and fast food remnants.  Welles moves on...

     INT.  EDDIE'S BEDROOM -- DAY

     Eddie's throwing clothing into a suitcase, hurried.  Welles
     comes into the doorway, taking aim, edging forward.

                             WELLES
                 Hello, Eddie.

     Eddie spins, startled.

                             WELLES
                 Put your hands on your head.

     Eddie looks out of the corner of his eye... to his GUN.

                             WELLES
                 Put your hands behind your head,
                 lock your finger together, get down
                 on your knees.

     Eddie does as commanded, gets to his knees.  Welles moves
     towards him, very nervous, white-knuckling the gun.
     He KICKS Eddie in the stomach, doubles him over.

                             WELLES
                 I owe you a few.

     Welles KICKS again.


     INT.  EDDIE'S KITCHEN -- DAY

     Welles enters the filthy kitchen, carrying Eddie's gun.  At
     the sink, Welles pops the gun's clip.  He pushes the bullets
     out into his palm, one by one.

     He dumps the bullets into the GARBAGE DISPOSAL, drops the
     clip in, turns it on.  The DISPOSAL makes a terrible
     GRINDING NOISE, straining, till it finally goes dead.

     INT.  EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY

     Welles goes to the picture window and closes the curtains.
     He turns on a lamp, goes back towards the bedroom.  After a
     moment, he returns, dragging Eddie on the floor...

     Eddie's bleeding out his nose, hands DUCT-TAPED together
     behind his back, legs bound at the ankle, dragged by a belt
     around his neck, choking...

     Welles drops the belt, undoes it from Eddie's neck.  Eddie
     gasps for air.  Welles pulls him up, puts him on the couch.

                             WELLES
                 Don't go anywhere.

     Welles heads for the stairs...

     EXT.  EDDIE'S GARAGE -- DAY

     Welles goes to Eddie car, tries the door, it's unlocked...

     IN THE CAR

     Welles takes the thick THOMAS GUIDE map book off the dash.

     INT.  EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY

     Welles returns.  Eddie's on the floor, wriggling.  Welles
     drops the Thomas Guide on the coffee table, picks Eddie up,
     throws him back onto the couch.

                             EDDIE
                 I'm gonna kill you.

                             WELLES
                 Don't bore me with that bullshit.

                             EDDIE
                 How'd you find me here?

     Welles PUNCHES Eddie in the ear.

                             WELLES
                 Don't ask questions.

                             EDDIE
                 Fuck you! 

     Welles PUNCHES Eddie in the same ear.  Eddie's hurting.
     Welles rubs his aching knuckles.

                             WELLES
                 Starting to recognize a pattern?

                             EDDIE
                 What do you want?

                             WELLES
                 Who is Machine?

                             EDDIE
                 I don't know...

                             WELLES
                 I want his name.

                             EDDIE
                 I told you, I don't know.

                             WELLES 
                 I will never get tired of hurting
                 you, Eddie, so you might want to
                 change your attitude.

                             EDDIE
                 What the fuck am I gonna protect
                 that freak for?  He was Dino's boy,
                 not mine.  He shows up with his mask
                 on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody
                 knows.

     Welles kicks junk off a chair, sits, takes out his gun.

                             WELLES
                 Okay, we'll come back to that.  So,
                 six years ago a guy contacts you,
                 through the classifieds, over the
                 phone, however he does it.  It's
                 Longdale, looking for a snuff film.
                 And you, entrepreneur that you are,
                 tell him you can hook him up.

                             EDDIE
                 Yeah, the fucking lawyer.

                             WELLES
                 Told him you could get him a snuff
                 film.

                             EDDIE
                 Yeah.

                             WELLES
                 How much did he pay you?

                             EDDIE
                 Thirty thousand each, that fucking
                 cocksucker.

                             WELLES
                 That's all?  Thirty each.  That's
                 all it took for you to murder her?

                             EDDIE
                 It was a lot of fucking money.

     Welles stands and paces, despairing.  He picks up a LAMP and
     throws it, SHATTERS a MIRROR, keeps pacing...

                             WELLES
                 So... you brought Dino in, and he
                 brought Machine.  And, one day, a
                 girl walked into your office because
                 you had an ad in the paper for
                 models.  And she never walked out.

                             EDDIE
                 Something like that.

                             WELLES
                 What did you do, knock her out,
                 shoot her up... ?

                             EDDIE
                 What the fuck do you want from me?

                             WELLES
                 I want to know.  I want to know
                 exactly what you did to her!

                             EDDIE
                 Fuck you then, you want to know?  I
                 talked her up, told her how
                 beautiful she was, told her she was
                 gonna be a star.  I told her I was
                 gonna get her a screen test, and
                 while I'm doing that, I got her a
                 soda and dropped a mickey.  When it
                 was dark enough, I rang Dino and
                 told him it was go time, I put her
                 in the trunk of my car and we went
                 and we fucking did it.  That's what
                 happened.  She's dead.  She's been
                 dead a long fucking time.  Nobody
                 fucking cares!

     Welles puts down his gun, picks up the Thomas Guide, holding
     it in both hands, SWINGS -- SLAMS Eddie across the face...

     Eddie's stunned, lips bleeding.  He faces forward.

                             EDDIE
                 You wanted to know, now you know.

     Welles SWINGS the Thomas Guide -- POUNDS Eddie's face again.

     Welles drops the Thomas Guide in a chair, picks up his gun,
     leaves the room...

     INT.  EDDIE'S KITCHEN -- DAY

     Welles enters, starts looking through DRAWERS, searching.
     He finds SILVERWARE, selects a serrated STEAK KNIFE...

     INT.  EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY

     Welles returns, goes to grasp Eddie by the shirt collar,
     drags him to the floor, face down.  Welles stands on Eddie's
     neck, uses the knife to cut the duct tape on Eddie's hands.

                             EDDIE
                 That's right, motherfucker, cut me
                 loose.  Be a man.

     Welles tosses the knife, gun trained on Eddie, picks up the
     Thomas Guide and throws it at Eddie... 

                             WELLES
                 Show me!

     Eddie, hands now free, pushes himself to a seated position,
     looks at the Thomas Guide.

                             WELLES
                 Show me where you did it, on the
                 map, exactly where you did it.

                             EDDIE
                 Why?

                             WELLES
                 Because we're going there.


     EXT.  134 FREEWAY -- DAY

     Welles' rental car SPEEDS down the highway, east towards
     Pasadena, leaving the City of Los Angeles on the horizon.

     EXT.  MOUNTAIN HIGHWAY -- DAY

     Welles' car travels a winding HIGHWAY that serpentines up
     into the scenic, forested SAN BERNADINO MOUNTAINS.

     EXT.  BIG BEAR -- DUSK

     The sun is low.  Big Bear Lake is vast, surrounded by
     wilderness on all sides.  Welles' car follows a TWO-LANE
     ROADWAY that runs along the lake's southern shore.

     Welles' car passes sporadic SUMMER HOMES and CABINS.

     EXT.  DESERTED ROADWAY -- NIGHT

     Heavy forests border close to the road.  Welles' car travels
     alone, headlights on, slowing as it comes to an overgrown
     gravel DRIVEWAY with a rusty CHAIN strung across it.

     IN THE CAR

     Welles leans forward to look up at an old SIGN of broken
     neon and peeled paint: "<b>Big Bear Motor Lodge.</b>"

     Welles pulls forward, puts the car in reverse...

     ON THE ROADWAY

     Welles' car backs up, angling, till the rear bumper comes
     against the chain, BACKING... till the CHAIN SNAPS.

     Welles' car pulls forward across the empty roadway, turns
     around... accelerates down the overgrown driveway...

     EXT.  BIG BEAR MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT

     Welles' car comes down the driveway, into a small LOT.

     IN THE CAR

     THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: headlights reveal what's left of the
     abandoned MOTOR LODGE, a REGISTRATION OFFICE at the center
     with attached wings of rooms on both sides.

     The LEFT WING of rooms is a fire ravaged, burnt-out
     skeleton.  What remains of the OFFICE and RIGHT WING is
     boarded over, falling apart.  No window has gone unbroken.

     IN THE LOT

     Welles turns out headlights and parks.
     He gets out, walks to look up the driveway.  A CAR is HEARD.
     HEADLIGHTS can be seen a good distance away through the
     forest as the CAR PASSES.

     Welles goes to his car, unlocks the trunk and opens it.
     Eddie's lying in there, arms and legs bound, gagged.

     INT.  MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- NIGHT

     The door is shoved inward, hanging crooked by one hinge.
     Eddie enters first, hands still bound behind him.  Welles
     pushes Eddie forward, gun out.

     Welles turns on his penlight FLASHLIGHT, shining it into the
     room.  There dead leaves all over the floor.  The room's
     empty except for a CHAIR lying on its side.

     Welles sweeps the room with the inadequate light.  This is
     where Mary Anne Mathews died, vaguely recognizable from the
     snuff film, without the furniture.

                             EDDIE
                 What are we doing here?

     Welles goes to the bathroom door, keeping the gun trained on
     Eddie, pushes the bathroom door open with his foot...

     The bathroom's cracked MIRROR reflects the penlight and
     Welles' palely lit face.

                             WELLES 
                 That night... you didn't have to be
                 in the room, but you were.
                       (looks to Eddie)
                 Why?  Why did you watch?

     Eddie goes to the chair, tips it upright with his foot, sits.

                             EDDIE
                 I don't know.  I felt like it.  I
                 never saw anyone get done before.

                             WELLES
                 You enjoy it? 

                             EDDIE
                 Made me sick, but what did I care?
                 What did I care if some hump wants
                 to beat off to that.  It was just
                 something I was doing for money.

                             WELLES
                 Tell me what happened.

                             EDDIE
                 What do you want to know?  You saw
                 it, you saw the loop...

                             WELLES
                 Nobody saw you bring her in?

                             EDDIE
                 There wasn't nobody around.  This
                 place was a shit-hole.  I backed up
                 the car to the door and we carried
                 her in, like groceries.  Dino made
                 her eat a bunch of pills, we laid
                 out the plastic, put film in the
                 camera and Machine went to work.

                             WELLES
                 What did you do with her body?

                             EDDIE
                 Took it out the bathroom window.
                 Buried it in the woods.

                             WELLES
                 Show me.

     EXT.  BIG BEAR MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT

     Eddie and Welles come around the corner of the abandoned
     motel, Eddie leading the way, Welles following with gun and
     flashlight, into the dense forest...

                             EDDIE
                 What are you thinking you're gonna
                 do... ?

     Welles shoves Eddie ahead.

                             WELLES
                 Keep moving.

                             EDDIE
                 Where do you think you're taking
                 this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero,
                 avenge that little girl's death?
                 Gonna make everything right with the
                 world?  How you gonna do that... ? 

     FURTHER ON

     Welles and Eddie come over a hill, deeper into the forest...

                             EDDIE
                 You can't go to the cops.  All you
                 can do is cut me loose and walk
                 away, because you got nothing...

                             WELLES
                 Stop talking.

                             EDDIE
                 You got absolute zero.

                             WELLES
                 Show me where you buried her.

                             EDDIE
                 I don't know...
                       (nods to forest)
                 ... out there somewhere.

                             WELLES
                 Where?  Show me where.

                             EDDIE
                 I fucking don't know.  What do you
                 think... we weren't burying
                 treasure.  We didn't pace it out so
                 we could come back and get it.  We
                 dug a hole and we put her in it.
                 Your guess is as good as mine.

     Welles walks ahead of Eddie, distraught, shining his
     flashlight ahead across the indecipherable forest floor.

                             EDDIE
                 You'll never find her.  Nobody ever
                 will, and even if they did, it
                 doesn't mean nothing.  Bring in the
                 cops, bring in the F.B.I., fuck 'em
                 all.  Without the film, it never
                 happened.  Don't you get it?  It's
                 over.  You can't do anything.

     Welles turns, aims his gun at Eddie, furious.

                             WELLES
                 I can kill you.  I can leave you out
                 here, just like you left her.

     Eddie's not backing down.

                             EDDIE
                 Do it.

                             WELLES
                 Don't think I won't.

                             EDDIE
                 Do it!  Put me out of my misery so
                 I don't have to listen to you
                 whining anymore.  You think it's so
                 easy?

                             WELLES
                 Easy enough for you.

                             EDDIE
                 I never killed anyone.

                             WELLES
                 That's right, you just stood there
                 and watched, because you "felt like
                 it."  Almost makes you worse.

                             EDDIE
                 What do you want?  You want me to
                 fall to my knees and start crying
                 like a baby... ?

     Eddie walks towards Welles.  Welles backs away...

                             EDDIE
                 Where you going?  You're the one
                 with the gun.  Aren't I defenseless
                 enough?  Come on...

     Eddie comes ahead, defiant, the gun inches from his face.

                             EDDIE
                 Go ahead and kill me.  Kill me with
                 that gun, your gun, right,
                 registered in your name?  Dig the
                 hole yourself, with your bare hands,
                 bury the body with your bullets in
                 it.  Fucking do it!

     Welles step forward, presses the gun against Eddie's
     forehead, pulls back the hammer... 

     Eddie just stares back at Welles with hatred in his eyes.

     Welles is terrified, unsure... trying to muster the courage
     to do it... gun hand trembling... finger on the trigger...


     INT.  MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- NIGHT

     Eddie's thrown face down to the floor.  Welles comes to sit
     on Eddie's back, facing Eddie's feet, holsters his gun,
     takes out duct tape and grabs Eddie's feet, wrapping them...

                             EDDIE
                 You pussy.

     Welles keeps going around Eddie's ankles with the duct tape,
     till Eddie's securely bound.

     He rips the tape roll free and gets up, walking out...

                             EDDIE
                 Fucking pussy!

     EXT.  MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT

     Welles pulls the door closed behind him, walks to his car.

     IN THE CAR

     Welles opens the passenger door and sits, shaken, at his
     wit's end.  He opens the glove compartment, finds
     cigarettes, digs one out and lights it.

     He looks back to the motel room.

     He looks down to the glove compartment, at his CELLULAR
     PHONE.  After a moment, Welles picks up the phone, looks at
     it in his hand.

     IN THE LOT

     Welles gets out of the car, gets up on the hood, lays back,
     staring at the sky.  He closes his eyes, smokes.

     Welles opens the phone, looks at the illuminated numbers.
     He digs in his suit jacket pocket, takes out his notepad,
     pages through, studies one page.

     Welles sits up.  He gathers himself, throws his cigarette,
     dials a number, puts the cellular to his ear, afraid...

                             MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Hello... ?

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you
                 remember, I was there a few weeks
                 ago... asking about your daughter...

                             MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 I remember.  You just left...

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 I have to tell you something.  It
                 won't be easy for you to hear.  It's
                 about your daughter... Mary Anne...
                       (struggling)
                 When I... when I was there with you,
                 her diary, in your attic, in
                 silverware.  If you read it, you'll
                 know what I'm telling you is true... 

     Welles climbs off the car, paces, aching with misery...

                             MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
                 What are you talking about... ?

                             WELLES
                 She went to California, to Los
                 Angeles... she wanted to start over.
                 She wanted to be an actress...

                             MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
                 What... ?

     Tears comes to Welles' eyes.  It's the hardest thing he's
     ever had to do in his entire life.

                             WELLES
                 Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead.
                 She's dead.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Who is this... ?

                             WELLES
                 Someone... some men, they took your
                 daughter and they drugged her, and
                 they took her to a motel room...
                 they did terrible things to her...

                             MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
                 Who are you?

                             WELLES
                 They brought her into the room...
                 one man, he put a knife to her
                 throat and he raped her...

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 No...

                             WELLES
                 He raped her and...and...and he
                 murdered her...he cut her up with
                 knifes...

                             MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
                 No... no... no...

                             WELLES
                 They killed her, and they took her
                 out in the forest somewhere and they
                 buried her...

                             MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
                 Why... why are you doing this to
                 me... ?

                             WELLES
                 They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm
                 sorry.  It happened a month after
                 she ran away.  She's been dead all
                 this time...

     MRS MATHEWS is HEARD SCREAMING, letting out a CHOCKING SOB.
     Welles falls back against the car, holds his head, weeping...

                             WELLES
                 I'm sorry, I'm so sorry... there
                 wasn't anything anyone could do...

     Welles pushes disconnect, lowers the phone, drops it to the
     ground, utterly drained.  He puts his forearm over his eyes,
     gasping, sucking air...

     He looks to the motel room, tamping down his sorrow, willing
     it to fuel his rage...

     He takes out his gun, hands unsteady, determined, opens the
     gun and pours the bullets out.  He closes the gun and walks
     towards the motel room...

     INT.  MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

     Welles SHOVES the door aside.  The door's hinge breaks and
     the door falls...

     Eddie sits propped up against one wall, turns to look...

     The door SLAMS to the floor.

     Welles moves forward, enraged, closing on Eddie, raising his
     arm with the gun grasped by the butt...

     Eddie's eyes go wide with fear...

     Welles SWINGS the gun down at Eddie's head...

     EXT.  MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

     The only SOUNDS come from the NIGHT FOREST.  CRICKETS and
     distant BIRDS.  We can't see anything but the TOTAL DARKNESS
     through the open door of the room.  A CAR is HEARD, getting
     LOUDER as it passes, FAINTER as it gets further away.

     Finally, Welles comes to the doorway, in shock, steadying
     himself against the door frame, shirt and suit spattered
     red.  His gun hand and gun are soaked with dripping blood.

     Welles looks back into the room, backing away.  He turns and
     goes to his car...

     IN THE CAR

     Welles climbs in the driver's side, shoves his bloody gun
     into his holster, tries to wipe blood from his hand onto his
     shirt, revolted.  He starts the car. 

     INT.  EDDIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles enters and crosses through...

     INT.  EDDIE'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Welles goes to the kitchen sink, turns on the water, starts
     scrubbing his bloody hands, using dishwashing liquid,
     scrubbing his hands desperately under running water.

     EXT.  EDDIE'S GARAGE -- NIGHT

     Welles comes out of the house, goes to open the rear door of
     Eddie's car, looking through BOXES of Eddie's belongings...

     INT.  EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles comes up the stairs with a BOX, dumps the contents
     onto the living room floor: it's CHILD PORNOGRAPHY, Eddie's
     collection from the office, HUNDREDS of PHOTOS...

     INT.  EDDIE'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Welles pulls open Eddie's cabinets, searching.  He finds
     POTS and PANS, choosing a few of the largest...

     EXT.  EDDIE'S GARAGE -- NIGHT

     Welles uses a cut piece of GARDEN HOSE, siphoning GAS out
     from Eddie's car, filling several kitchen POTS...

     INT.  EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles comes up the stairs, carries POTS of gasoline, dumps
     the gasoline onto the pile of PHOTOGRAPHS...

     INT.  EDDIE'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles dumps gasoline over Eddie's bed...

     INT.  LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles stands at the pile of gasoline soaked photos, taking
     out a MATCHBOOK, lighting one, lighting the whole book...

     EXT.  EDDIE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

     Welles walks down the dark hill, heading to his car.  He
     gets in, starts the car and drives downhill, leaving the
     headlights off.  BEHIND, the windows of Eddie's ramshackle
     HOUSE grow bright as FIRE SPREADS and CURTAINS BURN.


     INT.  LOS ANGELES AIRPORT -- NIGHT

     Welles stares ahead, in fresh shirt and suit, waiting at a
     CHECK-IN COUNTER. 

     The female AIRLINE AGENT behind the counter types in her
     COMPUTER, stamps his ticket.

     Welles shifts his gaze, something catches his eye...

     Beside a stapler on the counter, a PAIR of SCISSORS.

                             AGENT
                 There you are, Mr. Welles, confirmed
                 through to Kennedy.  Gate 32B.

     Welles stares, fixated on the SCISSORS.

                             AGENT
                 Mr. Welles?

     Welles looks to the agent holding up the ticket.

                             AGENT
                 Gate 32B.

     Welles accepts the ticket.


     EXT.  MANHATTAN MOTEL -- NIGHT

     The Empire State Building in the distance says NYC, and a
     CAMERA PAN DOWN says another seedy MOTEL...

     INT.  MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles sits at a small desk, looking through a PHONE BOOK,
     white pages, finds... "<b>HOSPITALS.</b>"

     Welles picks up the PHONE, chooses a number, dials it...

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Hello, can you connect me with the
                 duty nurse?
                      (waits)
                 Hello, this is Lieutenant Anderson
                 down here in the Thirteenth
                 Precinct.  I've got a helluva
                 problem I was hoping you could give
                 me a hand with.  We had a stabbing
                 incident a couple of days ago, and
                 it looks like the supposed victim
                 gave us a false name and address.
                 Can you tell me if you had an adult
                 male with an abdominal wound in you
                 ER in the last forty-eight hours?
                       (listens)
                 You'd remember this guy; a body-
                 builder, real big guy, five foot
                 eleven, with acne all over his chest
                 and back...
                       (listens)
                 Alright, thanks for your help. 

     Welles hangs up, uses a pen to cross out a number in the
     phone book, starts dialing the next number.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:

     INT.  MOTEL ROOM -- LATER NIGHT

     Welles lies on the bed, on the phone, rubbing his eyes.

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 ... guy sticks out like a sore
                 thumb.  Five foot ten or eleven,
                 body-builder, bad acne...
                       (listen)
                 Okay, thanks anyway.

     Welles gets up, hangs up, brings the phone back to the desk.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:

     INT.  MOTEL ROOM -- MORNING

     The PHONE BOOK'S open on the desk with nearly a hundred
     hospital phone numbers crossed out.

                             WELLES (O.S.)
                 ... abdominal wound.  You'd know him
                 if you saw him... 

     Light cuts into the room from between the curtains.  Welles
     paces, carrying the phone with him, weary.

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 He's a body-builder, stands just
                 under six feet...

     Welles stops in his track, listening, suddenly attentive.

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 That's right... covered in acne.
                 That's him, that's the guy.  Listen,
                 we, uh... we think he filed a bogus
                 report on this stabbing, gave us a
                 false name and address...
                       (listens)
                 Yes, I'll hold.

     Welles goes to the desk, takes out his notepad.  He starts
     feeling his pockets for his pen, can't find it, telephone
     book, searching, looks under the desk...

     Welles ducks under the desk to grab the pen off the floor.

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Yes... yes.
                       (sits, writing in pad)
                 Christopher Higgins.  Thirty-
                 fifteen, Thirty Fifth Street.
                 Where?  Astoria, Queens.

     Welles is scribbling all this down in his notepad.


     EXT.  QUEENS STREET -- DAY

     A relatively quiet residential street.  HOMES are small, two
     story affairs, close together, each very much like its
     neighbor, some with tiny yards fenced in by brick walls.

     Welles' Ford comes slowly down the street.  CHILDREN in
     school uniforms are heading off for the day in groups.

     Welles parallel parks.

     IN THE CAR

     Welles turns off the engine.
     He's watching a HOUSE on the other side of the street.  The
     house is brick on the bottom, aluminum siding on top,
     quaint, with brick staircase from the front door down to a
     GARAGE underneath, plastic PINK FLAMINGOS on the small lawn.

     Cars pass in the street.  Welles watches school children
     pass on the near sidewalk.  He slumps down a little in his
     seat, adjusting the rearview mirror, adjusting his side
     mirror, rolling up the window.

     Welles takes a cautionary look around, takes out his gun,
     pours bullets out and pockets them.  He picks up a PAPER BAG
     off the passenger seat and opens it.

     He takes out a long, thin metal FILE, pulling off the shrink
     wrap packaging, feels the file with his thumb.

     Keeping his open gun low under the steering wheel, Welles
     slides the file into the barrel, scraping gently all along
     the gun's inner barrel.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:

     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- LATER DAY

     Welles sits smoking a cigarette, watching the quaint house.
     He looks in his side mirror...

     There's a large CAR coming down the block with its turn
     signal on.  Welles slumps a little lower.

     The car passes, slowing.  The GARAGE DOOR of the quaint
     house begins to open. 

     Welles watches...
     Can't really see the driver of the car except for the back
     of his head, but he's huge.  It's a good bet it's Machine.
     Beside him in the passenger seat is a GREY HAIRED OLD WOMAN.

     The car pulls into the darkness of the quaint house's
     garage.  After a moment, the OLD WOMAN comes from the
     garage, walks with a cane, wears glasses.  She goes to the
     sidewalk, checks her MAILBOX, finds it empty.

     Welles watches.

     The old woman goes back to the garage.  She goes inside.
     The garage door closes behind her.

     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- NIGHT

     Welles still watches the house.  There's a light on in one
     of the second floor windows, curtains closed.

     Welles yawns, shaking his head, trying to stay awake.

     At the quaint house, a light comes on in the front picture
     window.  Looks like a living room or dining room.  The old
     woman comes to sit at a table.

     Welles takes binoculars off the front seat...

     THROUGH BINOCULARS

     The old woman says something to someone we cannot see.
     She's at the dinner table, with a place setting in front of
     her.  After a moment, someone joins her...

     It's Machine, you can tell by his bulk, by his huge
     forearms.  The lacy curtains of the window block part of our
     view, so we never see his face.

     IN THE CAR

     Welles lowers the binoculars, still watching.

     Through the window across the street, Machine can be seen
     putting a plate of food in front of the old woman.  The old
     woman smiles up at him, says something.

     Machine goes to light two candles on the table with matches,
     then goes back to stand beside the old woman.

     Machine is seen from behind, bends to give the old woman a
     kiss on the cheek, then leaves the room.  The old woman
     starts to eat.

     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- DAY

     Dawn light is just breaking.  Welles has fallen asleep,
     slumped low behind the wheel, snoring lightly.

     Welles awakens with a start, looking around, confused.  He
     calms, rubbing his eyes, wiping sweat from his features.

     ACROSS THE STREET

     The quaint house's garage door begins to rise.

     IN THE CAR

     Welles sees this, keeps low, watching...
     The big car backs out into the street.  The old woman's
     behind the wheel, wearing a hat, driving away, alone.

     Welles watches the car head away in the rear view mirror.

     ON THE STREET

     Welles gets out of his car, shuts the door quietly behind
     him.  He starts walking towards the quaint house, looks all
     directions, making sure no one's around.

     Ahead, the garage door begins to close.

     Welles picks up the pace, trying not to look too
     conspicuous.  The garage door's halfway down...

     Welles runs towards the garage, has to dive and roll to get
     there, but he makes it under the door just as it closes.

     ABOVE

     In ONE WINDOW of the quaint house, an eyeball is peering out
     from lacy curtains, then moves away and curtains fall shut.

     INT.  QUAINT HOUSE, GARAGE -- DAY

     Welles gets up, takes out his gun, brushing off.
     The garage is dark, full of BOXES and JUNK.  Welles moves
     towards the door to the house.

     INT.  QUAINT HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY

     Machine, in T-shirt and jeans, <u>seen only from behind</u>, comes
     to a DRESSER and opens a bottom drawer.  His huge hands push
     clothing aside, digging deep to the bottom of the drawer,
     taking out the WRESTLING MASK.

     Machine stands straight, pulling the mask down over his head.

     INT.  BASEMENT -- DAY

     Welles enters from the garage, gun up.  The dank basement is
     small.  A PILE of LAUNDRY lies on the floor near a WASHING
     MACHINE. 

     SHEETS hang off several CLOTHES LINES strung across two
     metal poles.  Welles leads with his gun...

     He moves around the sheets, looking behind them.  There's a
     WOODEN STAIRCASE leading upstairs.  Welles starts up,
     treading lightly, trying not to make a sound...

     INT.  KITCHEN -- DAY

     Welles slowly opens the door to the kitchen, pointing his
     gun.  No one here.  The decor is feminine, neat and tidy.
     It's grandma's house, and it shows, with gaudy PRINT
     WALLPAPER everywhere, every shelf displaying HUMMEL
     FIGURINES or COLLECTORS PLATES.  Very Home Shopping Network.

     INT.  DINING ROOM/LIVING ROOM -- DAY

     Welles slowly opens the swinging door, entering from the
     kitchen, sweeping the room with his gun.  No sign of
     Machine.  The whole house is dead quiet.

     He passes the dining room TABLE where he watched the old
     woman eat last night... passes fake PAINTINGS on the walls,
     of waterfalls and sunset mountain landscapes... moves into
     the living room area...

     Yellow shag CARPET.  A pink SOFA is covered in clear
     plastic, facing an old TELEVISION in faux-wooden cabinet.
     Welles heads for a staircase leading to the second floor.

     Welles creeps up the stairs...

     INT.  SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY

     Welles comes up from the stairs, arrives at a closed DOOR.
     He opens the door.  It's a linen closet, with TOWELS and
     SHEETS on shelves, and a shelf of MEDICINE.

     Welles shuts the door and moves on.  There are TWO DOORS
     ahead, both closed.  Welles takes the one to the right...

     INT.  MACHINE'S BEDROOM -- DAY

     Welles pushes the door in, enters warily.  There's a
     constant SCRATCHING HEARD.  The room is like a child's,
     except the BED is huge.  Shelves are full of BOARDGAMES and
     COMIC BOOKS.  A DANZIG POSTER on the wall.  There's a RECORD
     PLAYER with LP RECORDS beside it.  A record turns on the
     turntable, the needle caught at the center, SCRATCHING...

     Welles eases his way over to the closet... reaching...
     Pulls it open, steps back, gun up.  Nothing.  Just clothing.

     INT.  SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY

     Welles crosses, opens the door across the hall, enters...

     DOWN THE HALL, very slowly, Machine's head rises on the
     stairs, in the garish wrestling mask, peering.

     INT.  GRANDMA'S ROOM -- DAY

     Welles stays near the door, looks around.  There's a fuzzy
     sky-blue COMFORTER on the bed, fuzzy blue SLIPPERS nearby.
     Lots of bottles of MEDICINE on the bedside table.

     Welles lowers his gun, takes a step back, into the hall...

     INT.  SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY

     Welles turns...
     Machine charges down the hall, screaming with rage, BOWIE
     KNIFE raised to kill...

     Welles brings his gun up, but Machine's upon him, stabbing...

     Welles catches Machine's hand, stops the knife.  Machine
     grips Welles' gun hand, shoving him back...

     Welles is SLAMMED against the wall, grappling, gun hand
     pinned.  Welles GUN GOES OFF, once... twice...

     BLOWING HOLES in the ceiling.  Machine's grunts, pushing the
     knife forward... closer to Welles, face... closer...

     Welles struggles, overpowered.  The tip of the horrible
     knife is inches away...

     Welles bends his knees, crouching, trying to gain distance
     from the blade...

     Machine pulls Welles gun hand lower, brings it against the
     swinging LAUNDRY CHUTE DOOR built into the wall, begins
     twisting Welles' hand back, trying to pry the gun loose...

     Welles looks out the corner of his eyes to his gun...

     Welles turns his gun hand, slowing struggling to aim the gun
     towards the knife, but it's awful close to his face...

     The knife's shaking, less than an inch from Welles' cheek...

     Welles shuts his eyes and turns his head, letting out a CRY,
     FIRES his gun...

     The bullet BLASTS Machine's knife, knocks it away!

     Machine recoils for a millisecond, but brings his now free
     hand to Welles' throat, choking him.  Welles' face reddens,
     bleeding from bullet fragments...

     Welles tries to pry Machine's fingers from his throat.

     Machine works on Welles' gun hand with violent, renewed
     effort -- SLAMS Welles' hand against the laundry chute...
     SLAMS it... SLAMS it... till Welles DROPS the GUN...
     The gun can be HEARD CLATTERING down the chute. 

     Machine brings his hand to join the other around Welles'
     throat.  Welles can't break the grip...

     Welles PUNCHES Machine's face, till blood runs out from the
     mask's nose hole, but it's having no effect...

     Welles brings his KNEE UP HARD -- into Machine's stomach!

     Machine falls to his knees with a ROAR, holds his already
     wounded stomach, bleeding through his shirt...

     Welles falls, clutching his throat, gasping.  He struggles
     to his feet, leaps past, headlong towards the stairs...

     Machine rises, charging after...

     ON THE STAIRCASE

     Welles is TACKLED from behind...
     Welles and Machine TUMBLE down the stairs, SMASHING the
     wooden railing, toppling a BOOKSHELF... LANDING HARD...

     Welles PUNCHES and KICKS, breaking free, running across the
     living room.  Machine rises to give chase...

     Welles grabs a dining room CHAIR and THROWS it...
     Machine knocks the chair aside, keeps coming.  Welles grips
     another chair, uses it to hold Machine off...

     Machine grips the chair by the legs.  Welles SHOVES forward,
     pushes Machine back, letting go...

     Welles dives under the dining table, crawling on his hands
     and knees, scrambling...

     Machine throws the chair, runs, leaps...
     Machine lands on the table, crawls to the far edge, GRABBING
     down with his meaty fists as Welles moves forward...

     Under the table, Welles jerks back, avoiding, then rises,
     extending his knees, PUSHING upwards from underneath...

     Welles FLIPS the table, throwing Machine to the floor...

     Welles charges towards the kitchen door, falls, gets up...
     Machine gets to his feet...

     IN THE KITCHEN

     Welles SHOVES through the swinging door...
     Machine BURSTS through, catching Welles, TACKLING him...

     Welles hits the floor with Machine on top.  Machine begins
     to rein PUNCHES down on Welles, head and back...

     Welles tries to cover up, taking a real beating...

     Machine rises, gripping Welles, LIFTING him, THROWS him...

     Welles SMASHES into shelves of knick-knacks over the kitchen
     sink, SHATTERING a WINDOW, landing on the sink and counter.

     Machine comes to grip Welles again, drags him across the
     counter, KNOCKING EVERYTHING to the floor...
     Machine SWINGS Welles, releases him...

     Welles SLAMS the refrigerator and slumps to the ground,
     tries to stay conscious, trying weakly to get back up...
     Machine comes to Welles, gets on his knees...

     Machine wraps his arm around Welles' neck from behind, gets
     him in a CHOKE HOLD, tightens his grip, cutting off Welles
     airway with his forearm...

     Welles tries to break Machine's impossible grip with one
     hand, begins searching the floor with his other hand...
     frantically feeling for anything he can use...

     Welles' face is blood red...

     Welles' hand grasps desperately... finds a FORK, grips it...

     Welles SWINGS the fork back, STABS it into Machine's thigh!

     Machine SCREAMS, releases Welles and falls back, reaching
     around to the fork...

     Welles gets to his knees, sucking air, turns to look...

     Machine crawls away, pulls the fork out with trembling
     fingers.  Beyond him, there's the BASEMENT DOOR.

     Welles gets to his feet, looking...
     He grabs a FRYING PAN off the counter, gripping it in both
     hands and moving towards Machine...

     Machine's getting up...
     Welles BASHES Machine in the face with an upward swing of
     the frying pan...

     Machine is sent backpedaling, CRASHING into the oven!

     Welles drops the pan, leaps over Machine, to the door...

     IN THE BASEMENT

     Welles comes down the stairs, falls when he gets to the
     bottom, barely has any strength left.  He looks all
     directions, sees the LAUNDRY CHUTE in the ceiling...

     Welles gets up, stumbling, falls to his knees at the PILE of
     dirty LAUNDRY, starts digging through it, searching
     desperately, throwing clothing aside...

     Behind, Machine comes down the stairs, a bloody mess...

     Welles searches the laundry pile... 

     Machine reaches the bottom of the stairs, heading for
     Welles.  Welles turns, has the GUN in hand, FIRES TWICE...
     HITTING Machine in the shoulder and stomach, knocking
     Machine a few steps backwards...

     Welles FIRES...

     Machine's HIT in the CHEST, falling back, into hanging
     laundry, pulling down the clothes line and sheets...

     Machine hits the ground, wrapped in sheets.

     Welles stands, still aiming the gun, pulls the trigger on an
     empty chamber.  Out of bullets.

     Machine's trying to pull free from the sheets, trying to get
     back up to his feet.  Welles lets out a sob, drops the gun,
     walking to Machine...

     Welles climbs onto Machine from behind, takes clothing line
     in hand, starts wrapping the cord around Machine's throat...

     Welles pulls back on the clothes line, pulling it tight...

     Machine tries to get his fingers around the cord.  Welles
     stands, pulling tighter, putting a foot on Machine's back,
     pulling the clothes line with all his might...

     The cord's cutting into Welles' hand, drawing blood.

     Machine, face down, lets out a gurgling sound, struggling,
     struggling... till he finally stops moving.

     Welles releases the cord, takes a step back, breathing hard,
     trembling.  He looks around the basement.

     Welles walks to pick up his gun, replaces the gun in his
     holster.  He stands looking at Machine.

     Welles walks to Machine, bends, grasps Machine wrestling
     mask, pulling it off.  He rolls Machine over...

     Welles stares down at Machine.  <u>We never see Machine's face</u>.

     INT.  KITCHEN -- DAY

     Welles comes up from the basement, slow, hurting.  He looks
     around at the damage done, looks down to see he's still
     holding Machine's mask.  He drops it.

     EXT.  QUAINT HOUSE -- DAY

     Welles crosses the street, going to his car.  He gets into
     his car, starts it, pulls out and drives away.


     EXT.  WELLES' HOUSE -- DAY

     BIRDS SING.  KIDS are kicking around a soccer ball down the
     street.  Welles' Ford arrives, pulls into the driveway.

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, FRONT HALLWAY -- DAY

     Welles comes in the front door, still a horrible mess.

                             WELLES
                 Hello?!  Amy?

     He waits.  The house is quiet.  No one home.


     EXT.  WELLES' HOUSE -- LATER DAY

     Dusk.  A CAR comes down the street, slows...

     IN THE CAR

     Amy sits forward, seeing Welles' car in the driveway.
     Cindy's in a child safety seat in back.

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, FRONT HALLWAY -- DAY

     Amy comes in the front door, carrying Amy.

                             AMY
                 Tom?!

     No answer.

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY

     Any pushes the bedroom door open and looks in.  Welles is
     asleep on the bed, still in his clothing and shoes.  Amy
     watches him sleep, sad.

     Amy backs out of the room, pulls the door shut.


     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Dark.  Welles sleeps, still in bloody clothing.  He's
     restless, shifting, MUTTERING under his breath.  Bad dreams.

     Welles suddenly sits bolt upright in the bed, looking around
     the dark room, breathing hard.

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Cindy's in her high-chair by the table.  Amy's at the
     KITCHEN SINK, washing vegetables, peeling potatoes.

     Welles comes to stand in the doorway behind her.  Amy turns
     to look at him.  It breaks her heart to see him so wounded,
     but she forces herself to continue working in the sink.

                             AMY
                 How much forgiveness do you think I
                 have in me?

     Welles comes into the kitchen, stands beside Cindy, puts his
     hand out and clasp's Cindy's tiny hand.

                             WELLES
                 I can't talk about it yet... not
                 yet.

     Amy keeps peeling potatoes, refuses to look at him.  Welles
     looks down at Cindy, pats Cindy's head, looks back at Amy.
     He stands looking at Amy for a long moment.


     EXT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BACKYARD -- DAY

     Welles wears his fishing cap, pushing his lawn mower, mowing
     his yard.  He has done some healing, though his face is
     still swollen and terribly bruised.

     INT.  KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Welles feeds Cindy with one hand, eating his own dinner with
     the other.  Amy's across the table, eating, watching them.

     INT.  BASEMENT -- DAY

     Welles works on the WATER HEATER, wrench in hand, reading an
     instruction sheet.  He puts the sheet aside, uses the wrench
     to begin loosening one of the pipe fittings.

     EXT.  WELLES' HOUSE -- NIGHT

     Welles drags two GARBAGE CANS from the garage to the street,
     leaving them by the mailbox, walking back to the house.

     INT.  BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles and Amy are in bed.  Amy's asleep, on her side,
     facing away from Welles.  Welles lays awake, on his back,
     staring up at the ceiling.

     INT.  SUPERMARKET AISLE -- DAY

     Welles pushes a cart down one aisle.  He looks at his LIST,
     takes a BOX of CEREAL off one shelf, puts it in the cart.

     INT.  SUPERMARKET CHECK-OUT -- DAY

     Welles waits in line with his cart.  It's a long line.
     He takes out his wallet, opens it.

     In the fold of the wallet, there's a PHOTO folded into
     quarters.  Welles unfolds it and looks at it dolefully.
     It's the PHOTO of Mary Anne Mathews, the image Welles
     printed from early in the snuff film.  Sad girl. 

     Welles folds in back up, puts it in another pocket.  He
     looks forward in the line to see if it's moving.

     EXT.  SUPERMARKET -- DAY

     Welles transfers BAGS of GROCERIES from the shopping cart
     into the back seat of his Ford.

     INT.  WELLES' FORD -- DAY

     Welles drives on the HIGHWAY, groceries in back.  He watches
     the roadway ahead.  There's little traffic.

     Welles glances down, turns on the RADIO.  Some CLASSICAL
     MUSIC PLAYS.  Welles stares forward through the windshield.

     After a moment, Welles turns the RADIO OFF.  He drives.  The
     ONLY SOUND is the DRONE of the ENGINE and TIRES.

     Welles is suddenly overwhelmed by emotion, eyes filling with
     tears.  He tries to fight it, but can't help himself.  His
     face contorts with sorrow and he cannot stop crying, letting
     out a loud WAIL of misery...

     EXT.  HIGHWAY -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

     Welles' car moves to the shoulder, brakes to a sudden HALT.

     INT.  WELLES' FORD -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

     Welles takes great deep breathes and lets them out, over and
     over again, wiping at his tears.  He lets out a little high-
     pitched WHINE from far back in his throat...

                             WELLES
                 Why... why... ?

     He's wracked by SOBBING.


     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, CINDY'S ROOM -- DAY

     Amy's in a chair, reading a BOOK, not far from Cindy's crib.
     Cindy's asleep.  The FRONT DOOR of the house is HEARD
     OPENING and CLOSING from far off in the house.  Amy looks up
     momentarily, then returns to reading.

     FOOTSTEPS can be HEARD coming through the house, getting
     CLOSER.  Amy looks up from her book.  The bedroom door's
     open a crack.  The door slowly pushes open.  Welles stands
     there, eyes red from crying.

                             AMY
                 Tom... ?

     Welles comes into the room, stands before Amy.  He gets to
     his knees, puts his head in Amy's lap, wraps his arms around
     her waist.  Amy holds him, worried, eyes filling with tears.

                             WELLES
                 I have to tell you... I have to tell
                 you what happened.  I have to tell
                 you everything, but we can't tell
                 anyone else.  No one else can ever
                 know.

     Amy runs her fingers through his hair, bends down to rest
     her head on his back, holding him with her eyes closed.
     Welles holds tighter.

                             WELLES
                 You're all I've got.  You're all
                 I've ever had.
                       (pause)
                 You're the only one who can save me.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                ALIENS

        FADE IN

        SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE - SPACE                            1

        Silent and endless.  The stars shine like the love of
        God...cold and remote.  Against them drifts a tiny chip
        of technology.

        CLOSER SHOT  It is the NARCISSUS, lifeboat of the
        ill-fated star-freighter Nostromo.  Without interior
        or running lights it seems devoid of life.  The PING
        of a RANGING RADAR grows louder, closer.  A shadow
        engulfs the Narcissus.  Searchlights flash on, playing
        over the tiny ship, as a MASSIVE DARK HULL descends
        toward it.

        INT. NARCISSUS                                            2

        Dark and dormant as a crypt.  The searchlights stream
        in the dusty windows.  Outside, massive metal forms can
        BE SEEN descending around the shuttle.  Like the tolling
        of a bell, a BASSO PROFUNDO CLANG reverberates through
        the hull.

        CLOSE ON THE AIRLOCK DOOR  Light glares as a cutting
        torch bursts through the metal.  Sparks shower into the
        room.

        A second torch cuts through.  They move with machine
        precision, cutting a rectangular path, converging.  The
        torches meet.  Cut off.  The door falls inward REVEALING
        a bizarre multi-armed figure.  A ROBOT WELDER.

        FIGURES ENTER, backlit and ominous.  THREE MEN in
        bio-isolation suits, carrying lights and equipment.  They
        approach a sarcophaguslike HYPERSLEEP CAPSULE, f.g.

                                   LEADER
                           (filtered)
                    Internal pressure positive.  Assume
                    nominal hull integrity.  Hypersleep
                    capsules, style circa late twenties...

        His gloved hand wipes at on opaque layer of dust on the
        canopy.

        ANGLE INSIDE CAPSULE  as light stabs in where the dust is
        wiped away, illuminating a WOMAN, her face in peaceful
        repose.

        WARRANT OFFICER RIPLEY, sole survivor of the Nostromo.
        Nestled next to her is JONES, the ship's wayward cat.

                                   LEADER
                           (voice over; filtered)
                    Lights are green.  She's alive. 
                    Well, there goes out salvage, guys.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

        INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - TIGHT ON RIPLEY - GATEWAY STATION    3 

        She's lying in a bed, looking wan, as a female MED-TECH
        raises the backrest.  She is surrounded by arcane white
        MEDICAL EQUIPMENT.  The Med-Tech exudes practiced
        cheeriness.

                                   MED-TECH
                    Why don't I open the viewport?
                    Watch your eyes.

        Harsh light floods in as a motorized shield slides into
        the ceiling, REVEALING a breathtaking vista.  Beyond the
        sprawling complex of modular habitats, collectively
        called GATEWAY STATION, is the curve of EARTH as seen
        from high orbit.  Blue and serene.

                                   MED-TECH
                    And how are we today?

                                   RIPLEY
                           (weakly)
                    Terrible.

                                   MED-TECH
                    Just terrible?  That's better
                    than yesterday at least.

                                   RIPLEY
                    How long have I been on
                    Gateway station?

                                   MED-TECH
                    Just a couple of days.  Do you
                    feel up to a visitor?

        Ripley shrugs, not caring.  The door opens and a MAN
        enters, although Ripley sees only what he is carrying.
        A familiar large, orange TOMCAT.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Jones!

        She grabs the cat like a life preserver.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (cooing baby-cat talk)
                    Come here Jonesy you ugly old
                    moose...you ugly thing.

        Jones patiently endures Ripley's embarrassing display,
        seeming none the worse for wear.  The visitor sits
        beside the bed and Ripley finally notices him.  He is
        thirtyish and handsome, in a suit that looks executive
        or legal, the tie loosened with studied casualness.  A
        smile referred to as "winning."

                                   MAN
                    Nice room.  I'm Burke.  Carter Burke.
                    I work for the company, but other
                    than that I'm an okay guy.  Glad to
                    see you're feeling better.  I'm told
                    the weakness and disorientation
                    should pass soon.  Side effects of
                    the unusually long hypersleep, or
                    something like that.

                                   RIPLEY
                    How long was I out there?  They
                    won't tell me anything.

                                   BURKE
                           (soothing)
                    Well, maybe you shouldn't worry
                    about that just yet.

        Ripley grabs his arm, surprising him.

                                   RIPLEY
                    How long?

        Burke gazes at her, thoughtful.

                                   BURKE
                    All right.  My instinct says
                    you're strong enough to handle
                    this...Fifty-seven years.

        Ripley is stunned.  She seems to deflate, her expression
        passing through amazement and shock to realization of
        all she has lost.  Friends.  Family.  Her world.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...

                                   BURKE
                    You'd drifted right through the
                    core systems.  It's blind luck that
                    deep-salvage team caught you when
                    they...are you all right?

        Ripley coughs suddenly as if choking and her expression
        becomes one of dawning horror.  Burke hands her a glass
        of water from the nightstand.  She slaps it away.  It
        shatters with a SMASH.  Jones dives, yowling.  Ripley
        grabs her chest, struggling as if she is strangling.
        The Med-Tech hits a console button.

                                   MED-TECH
                           (shouting)
                    Code Blue!  415.  Code Blue!
                    4-1-5!

        Burke and the Med-Tech are holding Ripley's shoulders as
        she goes into convulsions.  A DOCTOR and TWO TECHS run
        in.  Ripley's back arches in agony.

                                   RIPLEY
                    No...noooo!

        They try to restrain her as she thrashes, knocking over
        equipment.  Her EKG races like mad.  Jones, under a
        cabinet, hisses wide-eyed.

                                   DOCTOR
                    Hold her...Get me an airway, stat!
                    And fifteen cc's of...Jesus!

        AN EXPLOSION OF BLOOD beneath the sheet covering her
        chest!  Ripley stares at the SHAPE RISING UNDER THE
        SHEET.  Tearing itself out of her.

        HER P.O.V. as the sheet rises.  A GLIMPSE OF the
        CHITTERING HORROR...IT SCREECHES.

        TIGHT ON RIPLEY  screaming, snapping up INTO FRAME.
        Alone in the darkened hospital room.  She gasps for
        breath, clutching pathetically at her chest.  There is
        no demented horror rigging itself out of her.  Her eyes
        snap about wildly, slowly focusing on the reality of
        her safety.  Shuddering, bathed in sweat, she kneads her
        breastbone with the heel of her hand and sobs.

        A VIDEO MONITOR beside the bed snaps on.  A MED-TECH's
        face.

                                   MED-TECH
                    Bad dreams again?  Do you want
                    something to help you sleep?

                                   RIPLEY
                           (faint)
                    No.. I've slept enough.

        The Med-Tech shrugs and switches off.  Touching a button
        on the nightstand she opens the viewport, REVEALING
        Gateway and the turquoise Earth.  She hugs Jones to her
        and rocks with him like a child, still shattered by the
        nightmare.  Shivering.  Sleep is far off.

                                   RIPLEY
                    We made it, Jones.  We made it.

        But at what price?

                                                        CUT TO:

        EXT. PARK                                                 4   

        Sunlight streams in shafts through a stand of poplars,
        beyond which a verdant meadow is VISIBLE.

        EXTREME F.G.  Jones stalks toward a bird hopping among
        fallen leaves.  He leaps.  And smack into A WALL.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (voice over)
                    Dumbshit.

        WIDER ANGLE  as Jones steps back confused from the
        HIGH-RESOLUTION ENVIRONMENTAL WALL SCREEN, a sort of
        cinerama video-loop.  Ripley sits on a bench in what we
        now SEE is an ATRIUM off the medical center, still
        somewhere in the bowels of Gateway Station.  Benches.
        Some unenthusiastic potted trees.  The sterile corridors
        VISIBLE beyond glass doors b.g.

        Burke ENTERS in his usual mode, casual haste.

                                   BURKE
                    Sorry...I've been running behind
                    all morning.

        Ripley seems healthier now, but still a bit brittle.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Have they located my daughter
                    yet?

                                   BURKE
                    Well, I was going to wait
                    until after the inquest...

        He opens his briefcase, removing a sheet of printer
        hard copy, including a telestat photo.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Is she...?

                                   BURKE
                           (scanning)
                    Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married
                    name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six
                    ...at time of death.  Two years
                    ago.
                           (looks at her)
                    I'm sorry.

        Ripley studies the PHOTOGRAPH, stunned.

        The face of a woman in her mid-sixties.  It could be
        anybody.  She tries to reconcile the face with the
        little girl she once knew.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Amy.

                                   BURKE
                           (reading)
                    Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't
                    licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred
                    Parkside Repository, Little Chute,
                    Wisconsin.  No children.

        Ripley gazes off, into the pseudo-landscape, into the
        past.

                                   RIPLEY
                    I promised her I'd be home for
                    her birthday.  Her eleventh
                    birthday.  I sure missed that
                    one.
                           (pause)
                    Well...she has already learned
                    to take my promises with a grain
                    of salt.  When it came to flight
                    schedules, anyway.

        Burke nods, a simpatico presence.

                                   RIPLEY
                    You always think you can make it
                    up to somebody...later, you know.
                    But now I never can.  I never
                    can.

        Let's get one thing straight...Ripley can be one tough
        lady.  But the terror, the loss, the emptiness are, in
        this moment, overwhelming.  She cries silently.

        Burke puts a reassuring hand on her arm.

                                   BURKE
                           (gently)
                   The hearing convenes at 0930.  You
                   don't want to be late.

        INT. CORRIDOR - GATEWAY                                   5

        Elevator doors part and Ripley emerges, in mid-conversation
        with Burke.  DOLLYING AHEAD OF THEM as they move rapidly
        down the corridor.

                                   RIPLEY
                    You read my deposition...it's
                    complete and accurate.

                                   BURKE
                    Look, I believe you, but there are
                    going to be some heavyweights in
                    there.  You got Feds, you got
                    interstellar commerce commission,
                    you got colonial administration,
                    insurance company guys...

                                   RIPLEY
                    I get the picture.

                                   BURKE
                    Just tell them what happened.  The
                    important thing is to stay cool
                    and unemotional.

        INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - ON RIPLEY - GATEWAY                6

        She's not cool.  Not unemotional.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Do you people have earwax, of
                    what?  We have been here three
                    hours.  How many different ways
                    do you want me to tell the same
                    story?

        She faces the EIGHT MEMBERS of the board of inquiry at a
        long conference table.  Gray suits and grim faces.  They
        aren't buying.  Behind Ripley on a large VIDEO SCREEN,
        PARKER grins like a goon from his personnel mugshot.  His
        file prints out next to it.  BRETT's face and dossier
        replace it, and then the others as the SCENE continues...
        KANE, LAMBERT, ASH the android traitor, DALLAS.
        VAN LEUWEN, the ICC representative, steeples his fingers
        and frowns.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Look at it from our perspective.
                    You freely admit to detonating the
                    engines of, and thereby destroying,
                    an M-Class star-freighter.  A
                    rather expensive piece of hardware...

                                   INSURANCE INVESTIGATOR 
                           (dryly)
                    Forty-two million in adjusted dollars.
                    That's minus payload, of course.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    The shuttle's flight recorder
                    corroborates some elements of
                    your account.  That the Nostromo
                    set down on LV-426, an unsurveyed
                    planet, at that time.  That
                    repairs were made.  That it resumed
                    its course and was subsequently set
                    for self-destruct.  By you.  For

                    reasons unknown.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Look, I told you...

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    It did not, however, contain any
                    entries concerning the hostile
                    life form you allegedly picked up.

        Ripley sense the noose tightening.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Then somebody's gotten to it...
                    doctored the recorder.  Who had
                    access to it?

        The ECA (Extrasolar Colonization Administration)
        Representative (ECA REP) just shakes his head.

                                   ECA REP
                    Would you just listen to yourself
                    for one minute.

        Ripley glares at the ECA Rep, a woman on the ungenerous
        side of fifty.  Van Leuwen sighs with exasperation.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    The analysis team which went over
                    your shuttle centimeter by
                    centimeter found no physical
                    evidence of the creature you
                    describe...

                                   RIPLEY
                           (losing it) 
                    That's because I blew it out the
                    Goddamn airlock!
                           (pause)
                    Like I said.

                                   INSURANCE MAN
                           (to ECA Rep)
                    Are there any species like this
                    'hostile organism' on LV-426?

                                   ECA REP
                    No.  It's a rock.  No indigenous
                    life larger than a simple virus.

        Ripley grits her teeth in frustration.

                                   RIPLEY
                    I told you, it wasn't indigenous.
                    There was an alien spacecraft there.
                    A derelict ship.  We homed on its
                    beacon...

                                   ECA REP
                    To be perfectly frank, we've surveyed
                    over three hundred worlds and no one's
                    ever reported a creature which, using
                    your words...
                           (read from Ripley's
                           statement)
                    ...'gestates in a living human host'
                    and has 'concentrated molecular acid
                    for blood.'

        Ripley glances at Burke, silent at the far end of the
        table.  His expression is grim.  Her mouth hardens as
        a bit of the old nail-eating Ripley surfaces.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Look, I can see where this is
                    going.  But I'm telling you those
                    things exist.  Back on that planetoid
                    is an alien ship and on that ship
                    are thousands of eggs.  Thousands.
                    Do you understand?  I suggest you
                    find it, using the flight recorder's
                    data.  Find it and deal with it --
                    before one of your survey teams
                    comes back with a little surprise...

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That
                    will be...

                                   RIPLEY
                           (louder, stepping
                           on him)
                    ...because just one of those
                    things managed to kill my entire
                    crew, within twelve hours of
                    hatching...

        Van Leuwen stands, out of patience.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Thank you, that will be all.

        Ripley stares him down, glowering at the board.

                                   RIPLEY
                    That's not all, Goddamnit!  If
                    those things get back here, that
                    will be all.  Then you can just
                    kiss it good-bye, Jack!  Just kiss
                    it goodbye.

        Ripley turns sharply away, trembling with frustration
        and anger.  Dallas looks back at her from the video
        screen, his eyes burning from the photograph, as we:

                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. CORRIDOR                                             7

        Ripley kicks the wall next to Burke who is getting coffee
        and donuts at a vending machine.

                                   BURKE
                    You had them eating out of your
                    hand, kiddo.

                                   RIPLEY
                    They had their minds made up
                    before I even went in there.
                    They think I'm a head case.

                                   BURKE
                           (cheerfully)
                    You are a head case.  Have a donut.

        INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - TIGHT ON RIPLEY - LATER            8

        Van Leuwen clears his throat.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    It is the finding of this board of
                    inquiry that Warrent Officer Ellen Ripley,
                    NOC-14672. has acted with questionable
                    judgment and is unfit to hold an
                    ICC license as a commercial flight
                    officer.

        Burke watches Ripley taking it on the chin, white-lipped
        but subdued.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Said license is hereby suspended
                    indefinitely.  No criminal charges
                    will be filed at this time and you
                    are released on own recognizance
                    for a six month period of
                    psychometric probation, to include
                    monthly review by an ICC psychiatric
                    tech...

        INT. CORRIDOR                                             9

        DOLLY BACK as the conference room door bangs open and
        Ripley strides through.  She shrugs off Burke's
        restraining arm and catches up to Van Leuwen walking
        down the corridor.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (insistent)
                    Why won't you check out LV-426?

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                           (condescendingly)
                    Because I don't have to.  The
                    people who live there checked it
                    out years ago and they never
                    reported and 'hostile organism'
                    or alien ship.  And by the way,
                    they call it Acheron now.

                                   RIPLEY
                    What are you talking about.
                    What people?

        Van Leuwen steps into an elevator with some others, but
        Ripley holds the door from closing.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Terraformers...planet engineers.
                    It's what we call a shake 'n' bake
                    colony.  They set up atmosphere
                    processors to make the air
                    breathable...big job.  Takes
                    decades.  They've already been
                    there over twenty years.  Peacefully.

        The door tries to close.  Ripley slams it back.  People
        are getting annoyed.

                                   RIPLEY
                    How many colonists?

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Sixty, maybe seventy families.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (low)
                    Sweet Jesus.

                                   ELEVATOR PASSENGER
                    Do you mind?

        Ripley's hand slides off the door, strengthless.

        TIGHT ON HER  FROM INSIDE the elevator as the doors close
        like fate on her lost expression.

        EXT. ALIEN LANDSCAPE - DAY                               10

        A hideous, storm-blasted vista.  Tortured rock forms.
        Bleak twilight at midday.

        PAN SLOWLY ONTO a CORRODED METAL SIGN set in concrete
        pylons, which reads:

                       HADLEY'S HOPE - POP. 159
                         "WELCOME TO ACHERON"

        Some local has added below in spray-can graffiti
        "Have a nice day."  Gale-force wind SCREECHES around
        the steel sign, driving a freezing rain.

        The COLONY, b.g., is a squat complex with lots of
        floodlights.

        EXT. COLONY COMPLEX                                      11

        The town is a cluster of bunkerlike metal and concrete
        buildings connected by conduits.  Neon signs throw garish
        colors across the vaultlike walls, advertising bars and
        other businesses.  It looks like a sodden cross between
        the Krupps munitions works and a truckstop casino in
        the Nevada boondocks.

        Huge-wheeled tractors crawl toadlike in the rutted
        "street" and vanish down rampways to underground garages.

        ANGLE ON THE CONTROL BLOCK  the largest structure.  It
        resembles vaguely the superstructure of an aircraft
        carrier...a flying bridge.

        VISIBLE across a half kilometer of barren heath, b.g.,
        is the massive complex of the nearest ATMOSPHERE
        PROCESSOR, looking like a power plant bred with an active
        volcano.  Its fiery glow pulses in the low cloud cover
        like a steel mill.

        INT. MAIN CONCOURSE - NEAR CONTROL BLOCK                 12

        A central space, laid out like a scaled-down shopping
        mall with no styling flourishes.  We SEE a cross section
        of the types of people who have come to live on
        Godforsaken Acheron.  Tough.  Pragmatic.  "Grapes of
        Wrath" faces.  Calloused hands.  Not too many interior
        decorators.  Some children race in the corridor on things
        that look suspiciously like "Big Wheels."

        INT. OPERATIONS ROOM - CONTROL BLOCK                     13

        Jammed with computer terminals, technicians, displays...
        most of the business of running the colony flows through
        here.  It's high tech but used and scrungy.  Papers
        piled up.  Coffee cup rings.

        DOLLY AHEAD OF LYDECKER, the Assistant Operations Manager,
        as he catches up to the harried Operating Manager,
        SIMPSON.

                                   LYDECKER
                    You remember you sent some
                    wildcatters out to that
                    plateau, out past the Ilium
                    range, a couple days ago?

                                   SIMPSON
                    Yeah.  What?

                                   LYDECKER
                    There's a guy on the horn,
                    mom-and-pop survey team.  Says
                    he's homing on something and
                    wants to know if his claim will
                    be honored.

                                   SIMPSON
                    Christ.  Some honch in a cushy
                    office on Earth says go look at
                    a grid reference in the middle
                    of nowhere, we look.  They don't
                    say why, and I don't ask.  I
                    don't ask because it takes two
                    weeks to get an answer out here
                    and the answer's always 'don't
                    ask.'

                                   LYDECKER
                    So what do I tell this guy?

                                   SIMPSON
                    Tell him, as far as I'm concerned,
                    he finds something it's his.

        EXT. ACHERON - THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - A SIX-WHEELED     14
        TRACTOR - DAY

        It roars across corrugated rock, blasting through soggy
        drifts of volcanic ash.

        INT. TRACTOR                                             15

        At the controls, intent on a PINGING scope, is RUSS JORDEN,
        independent prospector.  Beside him is his wife/partner
        ANNE and in the back their two kids are playing among the
        heavy sampling equipment.

                                   JORDEN
                           (gloating cackle)
                    Look at this fat, juicy magnetic
                    profile.  And it's mine, mine,
                    mine.

                                   ANNE
                    Half mine, dear.


        NEWT, their six-year-old daughter, yells from the back...

                                   NEWT
                    And half mine!

                                   JORDEN
                    I got too many partners.

                                   NEWT
                    Daddy, when are we going back
                    to town?

                                   JORDEN
                    When we get rich, Newt.

                                   NEWT
                    You always say that.  I wanna go
                    back.  I wanna play 'Monster Maze.'

        Her older brother TIM sticks his jeering face close to
        hers.

                                   TIM
                    You cheat too much.

                                   NEWT
                    Do not.  I'm just the best.

                                   TIM
                    Do too!  You go in places we
                    can't fit.

                                   NEWT
                    So!  That's why I'm the best.

                                   ANNE
                    Knock it off!  I catch either of
                    you playing in the air ducts again
                    I'll tan your hides.

                                   NEWT
                    Mom.  All the kids play it...

                                   JORDEN
                           (reverently)
                    Holy shiiit!

        ANGLE THROUGH FRONT CANOPY  ON a bizarre shape looming
        ahead.  An enormous bonelike mass projecting upward from
        the bed of ash.  The tractor slows.

        Canted on its side and buckles against a rock outcropping
        by the lava flow, it is still recognizable as an
        EXTRATERRESTRIAL SHIP.  Bio-mechanoid.  Nonhuman design.

                                   JORDEN
                    Folks, we have scored big this
                    time.

        EXT. TRACTOR                                             16

        Jorden and Anne step down, wearing ENVIRONMENT SUITS.
        Carrying LIGHTS, PACKS, CAMERAS, TEST GEAR.  Their

        breath clouds in the chill air.

                                   ANNE
                    You kids stay inside.  I mean
                    it!  We'll be right back.

        They trudge toward the alien derelict.

                                   ANNE
                    Shouldn't we call in?

                                   JORDEN
                    Let's wait till we know what to
                    call it in as.

                                   ANNE
                           (nervous)
                    How about 'big weird thing'?

        They pause at a twisted gash in the hull.  Blackness
        inside.

        INT./EXT. TRACTOR                                        17

        Newt has her face pressed to the glass, steaming it.
        Watching her parents enter the strange ship.  Tim GRABS
        HER from behind.  She SHRIEKS.

                                   TIM
                    Cheater!

        EXT. LANDSCAPE - NIGHT                                   18

        The tractor and the derelict are dark and motionless.
        The wind HOWLS around them.

        Tim is curled up in the driver's seat.  Newt shakes him
        awake, trying hard not to cry.

                                   NEWT
                    Timmy...they've been gone a
                    long time.

        Tim considers the night.  The wind.  The vast landscape.

        He bites his lip.

                                   TIM
                           (quavering)
                    It'll be okay, Newt.  Dad knows
                    what he's doing.

        CRASH!  Newt SCREAMS as the door beside her is RIPPED
        OPEN.  A dark shape lunges inside!

        Anne, panting and terrified, grabs the dash mike.

                                   ANNE
                    Mayday!  Mayday!  This is
                    Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner
                    calling Hadley Control.
                    Repeat.  This is...

        As Anne shouts the mayday Newt looks past her, to the
        ground.  Russ Jorden lies there inert, dragged somehow
        by Anne from inside the ship.  There is SOMETHING ON
        HIS FACE.  An appalling MULTILEGGED CREATURE, pulsing
        with obscene life.  Newt begins to SCREAM hysterically,
        competing with the shrieking wind which rises to a
        crescendo as we:

                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT - GATEWAY - DAY                  20

        Silence.  Ripley, looking haggard, sits at a table in
        the dining alcove contemplating the smoke rising from
        her cigarette.  The place is modest, to be charitable,
        and there are few personal touches.  Though it's late
        in the day Ripley is still wearing a robe.  The bed is
        unmade.  Dishes in the sink.  Jones prowls across the
        counter.  The WALLSCREEN is on, blaring vapidly.

                                   VOICE FROM VIDEO
                           (o.s.)
                    Hey, Bob!  I heard you and the
                    family are heading off for the
                    colonies!

                                   BON
                           (o.s.)
                    Best decision I ever made, Bill.
                    We'll be starting a new life
                    from scratch, in a clean world.
                    No crime.  No unemployment...

        The door BUZZES.  Ripley jumps like a cat.  Jones doesn't.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                            21

        Carter Burke stands in the narrow, dingy corridor with
        LIEUTENANT GORMAN, Colonial Marine Corps.  Young and
        severe in his officer's dress-black.  The door opens
        slightly.

                                   BURKE
                    Hi, Ripley.  This is
                    Lieutenant Gorman of the...

        SLAM.  Burke buzzes again.  Talks to the door...

                                   BURKE
                    Ripley we have to talk.
                           (pause) 
                    They've lost contact with the
                    colony on Acheron.

        The door opens.  Ripley considers the ramifications of
        that.  She motions them inside.

        INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT - A LITTLE LATER                 22

        Burke and Gorman are seated, nursing coffee.  Ripley
        paces, very tense.

                                   RIPLEY
                    No.  There's no way!

                                   BURKE
                    Hear me out...

                                   RIPLEY
                    I was reamed, steamed and
                    dry-cleaned by you guys...and
                    now you want me to go back out
                    there?  Forget it.

        We SEE that she's gut scared, covering it with anger.
        Burke sees it.

                                   BURKE
                    Look, we don't know what's going
                    on out there.  It may just be a
                    down transmitter.  But if it's
                    not, I want you there...as an
                    advisor.  That's all.

                                   GORMAN
                    You wouldn't be going in with the
                    troops.  I can guarantee your
                    safety.

                                   BURKE
                    These Colonial Marines are
                    some tough hombres, and they're
                    packing state-of-the-art firepower.
                    Nothing they can't handle...right,
                    Lieutenant?

                                   GORMAN
                           (cool)
                    We're trained to deal with these
                    kinds of situations.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (to Burke)
                    What about you?  What's your
                    interest in this?

                                   BURKE
                    Well, the corporation co-financed
                    that colony with the Colonial
                    Administration, against mineral
                    rights.  We're getting into a lot
                    of terraforming...'Building Better
                    Worlds.'

        Burke is revealing his early days in sales.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.

                                   BURKE
                    I heard you were working in the
                    cargo docks.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (defensive)
                    That's right.

                                   BURKE
                    Running loaders, forklifts, that
                    sort of thing?

                                   RIPLEY
                           (shrugging)
                    It's all I could get.  Anyway,
                    it keeps my mind off of...
                    everything.  Days off are worse.

                                   BURKE
                    What if I said I could get you
                    reinstated as a flight officer?
                    And that the company has agreed
                    to pick up your contract?

                                   RIPLEY
                    If I go.

                                   BURKE
                    If you go.
                           (pause)
                    It's a second chance, kiddo.  And
                    it'll be the best thing in the
                    world for you to face this fear
                    and beat it.  You gotta get back
                    on the horse...

                                   RIPLEY
                           (frosty)
                    Spare me, Burke.  I've had my
                    psych evaluation this month.

        Burke leans close, a let's-cut-the-crap intimacy.

                                   BURKE
                    Yes, and I've read it.  You
                    wake up every night, sheets
                    soaking, the same nightmare
                    over and over...

                                   RIPLEY
                           (shouting)
                    No!  The answer is no.  Now
                    please go.  I'm sorry.  Just
                    go, would you.

        Burke nods to Gorman who rises with him.  He slips a
        TRANSLUCENT CARD onto the table, heads for the door.

                                   BURKE
                    Think about it.

        EXT. ACHERON LANDSCAPE - NIGHT                           23

        As the wind HOWLS through tormented rock, BUILDING IN
        PITCH until we:

                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. APARTMENT                                           24

        Ripley lunges INTO FRAME with an animal outcry.  She
        clutches her chest, breathing hard.  Bathed in sweat
        she lights a cigarette with trembling hands.  Do we
        hear a faint, desolate wind?

        TIGHT ON PHONE CONSOLE  as Ripley's hand inserts Burke's
        card into a slot.  "STAND BY" prints out on the screen
        and is replaced by Burke's face, bleary with sleep.

                                   BURKE
                           (on video phone)
                    Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...

                                   RIPLEY
                    Burke, just tell me one thing.
                    That you're going out there to
                    kill them.  Not study.  Not bring
                    back.  Just burn them out...clean
                    ...forever.

                                   BURKE
                    That's the plan.  My word on it.

        CLOSEUP - RIPLEY  taking a deep slow breath.  It's time
        to look the demon in the eye.

                                   RIPLEY
                    All right.  I'm in.

        She punches off before Burke replies, before she can
        change her mind.  She turns to Jones sitting on the
        bed and her tone becomes admonishing...

                                   RIPLEY
                    And you my dear, are staying
                    right here.

        Jones blinks, cynical cat eyes..."count me right
        out."

                                                        CUT TO:

        EXT. DEEP SPACE - THREE WEEKS LATER                      25

        An empty starfield.  Metal spires slice ACROSS FRAME.

        A mountain of steel following.  A massive military
        transport ship, the SULACO.  Ugly, battered...
        functional.

        INT. CORRIDOR TO CARGO LOCK                              26

        An empty corridor, seemingly miles long.  No movement.
        The THRUMMING of hyperdrive engines.

        INT. CARGO LOCK                                          27

        An enormous chamber, cavernous and dark.  Squatting
        in the shadows are two orbit-to-surface shuttles.
        DROP-SHIPS.  Heavy machinery all around them...
        cranes, loading equipment.

        INT. BRIDGE                                              28

        Dark electronic womb.  CAMERA DOLLIES SLOWLY among
        murmuring instrumentation.  A sudden high-pitched
        TRILLING accompanies a sequence of lights.  An alarm.

        INT. HYPERSLEEP VAULT                                    29

        Blackness, until a bank of indicators lights up.
        Hydraulics lift a grid of equipment from a row of
        horizontal HYPERSLEEP CYLINDERS.  It reaches the
        ceiling.  Locks.

        CLOSE ON RIPLEY'S CAPSULE  as trickles of water run
        down the frosted canopy.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

        INT. HYPERSLEEP VAULT                                    30

        Lit up, white and sterile.

        The canopies of the row of capsules are raised.  Ripley
        sits up.  Rubs her arms briskly.  Next to her Gorman
        and Burke are stirring and beyond them the troopers,
        wearing shorts and dog tags.  They are:

           MASTER SERGEANT APONE                    UNIT LEADER

           CORPORAL HICKS                         B-TEAM LEADER

           CORPORAL DIETRICH (female)                  MED-TECH

           PFC HUDSON                                  COM-TECH 
           
           PFC VASQUEZ (female)            'SMART-GUN' OPERATOR

           PRIVATE DRAKE                   'SMART-GUN' OPERATOR

           PRIVATE FROST                                TROOPER

           PRIVATE CROWE                                TROOPER

           PRIVATE WIERZBOWSKI                          TROOPER

           CORPORAL FERRO (female)              DROP-SHIP PILOT

           PFC SPUNKMEYER                   DROP-SHIP CREW CHIEF

        The ship is fully automated in interstellar flight so
        there is no crew, except for EXECUTIVE OFFICER (ECA) Bishop,
        who supervises planetary maneuvering.

        GROANS echo across the chamber.

                                   SPUNKMEYER
                    Arrgh.  I'm getting too old for
                    this shit.

        SPUNKMEYER says this sincerely, though he must have
        enlisted underage not long ago.  Looking surly, DRAKE
        sits up.  He's young as well but street-tough.  Nasty
        scar curling his lip into a sneer.

                                   DRAKE
                    They ain't payin' us enough
                    for this.

                                   DIETRICH
                    Not enough to have to wake up
                    to your face, Drake.

                                   DRAKE
                    Suck air.  Hey, Hicks...you look
                    like I feel.

        HICKS, an older lifer-type who keeps his own counsel,
        just snorts good-naturedly.

        Ripley scans the group as they shuffle past her to a
        bank of lockers.  Though not supermen they are lean and
        hardened...tough, capable, jaded.  They combine the
        specialized techno-combat training of the twenty-first
        century fighting man with those qualities universal to
        "grunts" through the ages.  SERGEANT APONE moves down the
        row of freezers.

                                   HUDSON
                    This floor's freezing.

                                   APONE
                    Christ.  I never saw such a
                    buncha old women.  You want me
                    to fetch your slippers, Hudson?

                                   HUDSON
                    Would you, Sir?

        Ripley steps back as the troopers shuffle past nodding
        cursory hellos.  She feels isolated by the camaraderie
        of this tightknit group.

        VASQUEZ eyes her coldly as she passes.  Like Drake,
        Vasquez is younger then the rest and her combat-primer
        was the street in a Los Angeles barrio.  She is tough
        even by the standards of this group.  Hard-muscled.
        Eyes cunning and mean.

                                   HUDSON
                    Hey, Vasquez...you ever been
                    mistaken for a man?

                                   VASQUEZ
                    No.  Have you?

        She slaps Drake's open palm and it clenches into a
        greeting which is part contest.  It gets rougher.
        Painful.  Until she cuffs him hard and they break with
        vicious laughter.  Dobermans playing.  Conscripted from
        juvenile prison, the two of them were trained to
        operate the formidable "SMART-GUNS."  That is part
        of their bond.

        BISHOP is helping everyone like a valet.  As he passes
        close to her Ripley notices a strange TATTOO across
        the back of his left hand...an ALPHA-NUMERIC CODE.

                                   FROST
                    Hey, hand job, you take my
                    towel?

                                   SPUNKMEYER
                           (overlapping)
                    I need some slack, man.  How
                    come they send us straight back
                    out like this?  We got some slack
                    comin', man.

                                   HICKS
                    You just got three weeks.

                                   SPUNKMEYER
                    I mean breathing, not this frozen
                    shit.

                                   DIETRICH
                    Yeah, 'Top'...what about it?

                                   APONE
                    You know it ain't up to me.
                           (louder)
                    Awright!  Let's knock off the
                    grabass.  First assembly's in
                    fifteen...let's shag it.

        INT. SHOWERS                                             31


        High pressure water jets and a blast of hot air when
        you step out...a drive through car wash for people.
        Through the swirling steam Hudson, Vasquez and FERRO
        are watching Ripley dry off.

                                   VASQUEZ
                    Who's the fresh meat again?

                                   FERRO
                    She's supposed to be some kinda
                    consultant...
                    (exaggerated)
                    ...She was an alien once.

                                   HUDSON
                    Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.

                                   APONE
                    Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!

        INT. MESS HALL                                           32

        An unconscious segregation takes place at the troopers
        assemble at one long table while Gorman, Burke, Bishop
        and Ripley sit at another.  Everybody is nursing a
        coffee, waiting for eggs from the AUTOCHEF.  Among the
        troopers dress discipline is lax...fatigues customized
        and emblazoned with patches.  Drake's tunic is cut off
        to a vest and has "Eat the apple and fuck the Corps"
        stenciled on back.  "Peace Through Superior Firepower,"
        "Pray for War" and "I've Served My Time in Hell:  Cetti
        Epsilon NC-104" are some others.

                                   HUDSON
                    Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?

                                   APONE
                    Rescue mission.  There's some
                    juicy colonists' daughters we
                    gotta rescue from virginity.


        Apone is stocky, grizzled, with peregrine eyes.  He runs
        it loose and fair, but only because he knows his people
        are the best.

                                   SPUNKMEYER
                    Shee-it.  Dumbass colonists.
                    What's this crap supposed to be?

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                    Cornbread, I think.  Hey, I wouldn't
                    mind getting me some more a
                    that Arcturan poontang.  Remember
                    that time?

                                   HICKS
                           (low)
                    Looks like that new Lieutenant's
                    too good to eat with us grunts.

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                           (glancing
                           over shoulder)
                    Yeah.  Got a corn cob up his ass,
                    definitely.

        Across the room, at the other table, Gorman sits with
        his creases perfect...the consummate strack NCO.  Bishop
        takes a seat beside Ripley, who pointedly gets up and
        moves to the far side of the table.  He looks wounded.

                                   BISHOP
                    I'm sorry you feel that way
                    about Synthetics, Ripley.

        Ripley spins on Burke, her tone accusing.

                                   RIPLEY
                    You never said anything about an
                    android being here!  Why not?

                                   BURKE
                    Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's
                    been policy for years to have a
                    synthetic on board.

                                   BISHOP
                    I prefer the term 'artificial person'
                    myself.  Is there a problem?

                                   BURKE
                    A synthetic malfunctioned on her
                    last trip out.  Some deaths were
                    involved.

                                   BISHOP
                    I'm shocked.  Was it an older model?

                                   BURKE
                    Cyberdyne Systems 120-A/2.

        Bishop turns to Ripley, very conciliatory.

                                   BISHOP
                    Well, that explains it.  The
                    A/2's were always a bit twitchy.
                    That could never happen now with
                    out behavioral inhibitors.  Impossible
                    for me to harm or, by omission of
                    action, allow to be harmed a
                    human being.
                           (smiling)
                    More cornbread?

        WHAM!  Ripley knocks the plate out of his hand, halfway
        across the room.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Just stay away from me, Bishop!
                    You got that straight?

        Burke and Gorman exchange glances.

        Wierzbowski, at the next table, shrugs and turns back
        to the other troopers.

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                    She don't like the cornbread
                    either.

                    Tench-hut!

        WIDER ANGLE  as the troops snap to from their lounging
        among the racks of high-tech weaponry.  Gorman enters
        with Burke and Ripley.

                                   GORMAN
                    At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't
                    have time to brief before we
                    left Gateway but...

                                   HUDSON
                    Sir?

                                   GORMAN
                           (annoyed)
                    Yes, Hicks?

                                   HUDSON
                    Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.

                                   GORMAN
                    What's the question?

                                   HUDSON
                    Is this going to be a stand-up
                    fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?

                                   GORMAN
                    All we know is that there's
                    still no contact with the colony
                    and that a xenomorph may be
                    involved.

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                    A what?

                                   HICKS
                           (to Wierzbowski;
                           low)
                    It's a bug-hunt.
                           (louder)
                    So what are these things?

        Gorman nods to Ripley, who stands before the troops.
        She sets some RECORDING DISKETTES on the table.

                                   RIPLEY
                    I've dictated what I know on
                    these.

                                   APONE
                    Tease us a bit.

                                   SPUNKMEYER
                    Yeah...previews.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Okay.  It's important to understand
                    this organism's life cycle.  It's
                    actually two creatures.  The first
                    form hatches from a spore...a sort
                    of large egg, and attaches itself
                    to its victim.  Then it injects
                    an embryo, detaches and dies.
                    It's essentially a walking sex organ.
                    The --

                                   HUDSON
                    Sounds like you, Hicks.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (controlled)
                    The embryo, the second form, hosts
                    in the victim's body for several
                    hours.  Gestating.  Then it...
                           (with difficulty)
                    ...then it...emerges.  Moults.
                    Grows rapidly --

                                   VASQUEZ
                    I only need to know one thing.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Yes?

                                   VASQUEZ
                    Where they are.

        Vasquez coolly points her finger, cocks her thumbs, and
        blows away an imaginary alien.

                                   DRAKE
                    Yo!  Vasquez.  Kick ass!

                                   VASQUEZ
                    Anytime.  Anywhere.

                                   HUDSON
                    Somebody said alien...she
                    thought they said illegal alien
                    and signed up.


                                   VASQUEZ
                    Fuck you.

                                   HUDSON
                    Anytime.  Anywhere.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (icy)

                    Am I disturbing you conversation
                    Mr. Hudson?

        Hudson settles down, smirking.  Ripley locks eyes with
        Vasquez.

                                   RIPLEY
                    I hope you're right.  I really
                    do.

                                   BURKE
                           (to all)
                    I suggest you study the disks
                    Ripley has been kind enough to
                    prepare for you.

                                   GORMAN
                    Are there any questions?  Hudson?

                                   HUDSON
                    How do I get out of this
                    chicken-shit outfit?

        Gorman scowls then, thanking Ripley with a nod, takes
        over the predrop briefing.

                                   GORMAN
                    All right.  I want this to go
                    smooth and by the numbers.  I
                    want DCS and tactical database
                    assimilation by 0830.
                            (some groans)
                    Ordnance loading, weapons strip and
                    drop-ship prep details will have
                    seven hours...

        EXT. SPACE - ACHERON                                     34

        They have arrived.  From orbit the planet looks serene
        ...Pearlescent cloud cover masking the environmental
        torment beneath.  The SULACO floats, its MANEUVERING
        JETS FIRING.  A bluish glow.  Then twice more, rapidly.

        INT. BRIDGE                                              35

        Bishop is installed in his command seat, hemmed in by
        instrumentation.

                    Attention.  This concluded final
                    maneuvering operations.  Thank
                    you for your cooperation.  You
                    may resume work.

        INT. LOADING BAY - TIGHT ON MASSIVE FORKS - CARGO LOCK   34

        sliding into a heavy ordnance rack with an echoing
        CLANG.  PULL BACK as the rack of tactical missiles is
        lifted, REVEALING two powerful hydraulic arms.

        Spunkmeyer, seated inside a POWER LOADER, swings the
        ordnance up into a belly nacelle of the DROP-SHIP where
        it locks into place.  As he exerts pressure with his
        hands against the servo-controls the hydraulic arms
        move correspondingly...but with a thousandfold increase
        in power.  The forklift-style CLAWS on each arm can
        crush with tons of pressure.  The loader has an open
        ROLL CAGE to protect the operator, and is supported
        by squat HYDRAULIC LEGS which also move correspondingly
        with the driver's movements.

        You have never seen anything like this before.
        Advanced as it is to us, it's only an old forklift
        to them...battered and well used.  Covered with grease.
        Repainted many times.  Across the back is stencilled
        "CATERPILLAR."

        Spunkmeyer's machine swings out from under the drop-ship
        and we become aware of the intense activity throughout
        the cavernous loading bay.  Troopers on foot or driving
        TOW-MOWERS, OVERHEAD LOADING ARMS...all in motion.
        Hicks checks off items on an electronic manifest.

        INT. READY ROOM - ARMORY                                 37

        Wierzbowski, Drake and Vasquez are fieldstripping
        light weapons with precise movements.  Around them,
        in racks, is an arsenal of advanced personal
        artillery.

        Vasquez likes the feel of the guns, the weight...the
        authority.  Her hands move without hesitation.  CLACK.
        CLACK.  CLACK.  She swings one of the SMART-GUNS out
        on a work stand.  Using a body brace and GYRO-STABILIZED
        SUPPORT ARM, it is a computer-aimed, video targeted
        automatic weapon.  The futuristic equivalent of a .30
        caliber light machine gun.  Sort of a steadicam that
        kills.

        INT. LOADING BAY - ANGLE ON BURKE AND GORMAN             38

        with pre-flight activity b.g.

                                   BURKE
                    Still nothing from the colony?

                                   GORMAN
                    Dead on all channels.

        Ripley watches the drop-ship being loaded.  A cross
        between a Huey Aircobra gunship and the space shuttle
        might describe it.  An orbit-to-surface troop carrier,
        heavily armed for the close support of ground missions.
        She watches a six-wheeled APC, ARMORED PERSONNEL
        CARRIER, being raised hydraulically into the ship's
        belly.  Ripley looks around as Frost wheels a rack of
        incomprehensible equipment toward her.

                                   FROST
                    Clear, please.

        Ripley jumps aside, nodding apologetically.  She turns.
        Steps hastily back.  Hudson cruises by with a laden
        forklift.

                                   HUDSON
                    Excuse me.

        ANGLE ON APONE  standing with Hicks, as Ripley approaches
        him

                                   RIPLEY
                    I feel like a fifth wheel
                    here.  Is there anything I can
                    do?

                                   APONE
                    I don't know.  Is there anything
                    you can do?

                                   RIPLEY
                           (pointing)
                    I can drive that loader.  I've
                    got a Class Two rating.  My
                    latest career move.

        Apone turns.  A SECOND POWER LOADER sits unused in
        an equipment bay.

        TWO SHOT APONE AND HICKS  skeptical.  Considering.

        TIGHT ON POWER SWITCH  as Ripley's finger punches it on.
        A RISING WHINE of power.

        TIGHT ON THE HYDRAULICS  as the massive machine stirs
        to life.

        FULL, as the loader starts.  Ripley is strapped into
        the safety cage, her arms and legs inserted in the
        servo-sensor assemblies.  She takes a step.  BOOM!
        Two tons of hardened steel takes a step.

        Ripley spins the wrist servos.  The huge claws swing,
        open...slide smoothly into lifting brackets on a
        cargo module, nearby.  She raises it deftly.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Where you want it?

        Hicks looks at Apone, cocks an eyebrow appreciatively.

        INT. READY ROOM - ARMORY                                 39

        The troopers are suiting up for the drop.  Strapping on
        their bulky COMBAT-ARMOR...interlocking plates like
        football padding.  They tape their wrists.  Draw on
        segmented boots.  The sole cleats CLACK like hooves
        on the deck plates.  Lockers SLAM.

        WEB BELTS.  PACKS.  HARNESSES.  HELMETS.  COM-SETS.
        Their fingers move methodically over the fastenings.
        It has its own rhythm...CLICK.  CLICK.  CLICK.

                                   APONE
                    Let's move it, girls!  On
                    the ready line.  Let's go,
                    let's go.

        INT. DROP-SHIP - APC                                     40

        Ripley, wearing a flight jacket and headset, files into
        the ship with the hulking troopers.  Inside they pass
        directly into the APC we saw loaded earlier and take
        seats facing each other across a narrow aisle.  They will
        drop already strapped into their ground vehicle for
        rapid deployment.  A KLAXON SOUNDS, signalling
        depressurization of the cargo lock.

        Hudson prowls the aisle, his movements predatory and
        exaggerated.  Ripley watches him working his way toward
        her.

                                   HUDSON
                    I am ready, man.  Ready to get
                    it on.  Check-it-out.  I am the
                    ultimate badass...state of the
                    badass art.  You do not want to
                    fuck with me.  Hey, Ripley, don't
                    worry.  Me and my squad of
                    ultimate badasses will protect you.
                    Check-it-out...

        He slaps the SERVO-CANNON controls in the GUN BAY
        above them.

                                   HUDSON
                    Independently targetting
                    particle-beam phalanx.  VWAP!
                    Fry half a city with this puppy.
                    We got tactical smart-missles,
                    phased-plasma pulse-rifles,
                    RPG's.  We got sonic eeelectronic
                    ballbreakers, we got nukes, we
                    got knives...sharp sticks --

        Hicks grabs Hudson by his battle harness and pulls him
        into a seat.  His voice is low, but it carries.

                                   HICKS
                    Save it.

                                   HUDSON
                    Sure, Hicks.

        Ripley nods her thanks to Hicks.  MOTORS WHINE and the
        craft lurches.  Burke, next to Ripley, grins eagerly
        like this is a sport fishing trip.

                                   BURKE
                    Here we go.

        She looks like she's in a gas chamber waiting for the
        pellet to drop.

        The drop-ship lowers from the cargo-lock on a massive
        launch rig.  The night side of Acheron yawns below...
        enigmatic.

        INT. DROP-SHIP - APC                                     44

        Apone, stalking the aisle, snatches for a handhold.
        Bishop, Burke and Gorman groan at the sudden gees.
        Ripley closes her eyes...the point of no return.

        EXT. DROP-SHIP                                           45

        It screams down through the stratosphere, plunging
        into dark turbulence.

        INT. COCKPIT                                             46

        Beyond the canopy is gray limbo.  The craft shudders
        and lurches.

                                   FERRO
                           (icy calm)

                    Two-four-o.  Nominal to profile.
                    Picking up some hull ionization.

                                   FERRO
                    Got it.  Rough air ahead.

        INT. HOLD - APC                                          47

        TIGHT ON HICKS  asleep in his harness.

                                   FERRO
                           (voice over;

                    Stand by for some chop.

        TIGHT ON GORMAN  as the ship begins to buck, his eyes
        closed.  Pale.  Sweating.  He rubs his hands on his
        knees repeatedly.

                                   RIPLEY
                    How may drops is this for you,
                    Lieutenant?

                                   GORMAN
                    Thirty-eight...simulated.

                                   VASQUEZ
                    How many combat drops?

                                   GORMAN
                    Well...two.  Three, including
                    this one.

        Vasquez and Drake exchange do-you-believe-this-shit
        expressions.  Ripley looks accusingly at Burke.

        INT. COCKPIT                                             48

                                   FERRO
                    Turning on final.  Coming around to
                    a seven-zero-niner.  Terminal
                    guidance locked in.  Where's
                    the damn beacon?

        EXT. DROP-SHIP                                           49

        It emerges from the low cloud ceiling.  From the twilight
        haze ahead the distant colony LANDING BEACONS become
        visible.

        INT. HOLD - APC                                          50

        Stumbling as the ship pitches, Ripley makes her way
        forward to the MOBILE TACTICAL OPERATIONS BAY (MTOB),
        a control console lined with monitor screens.  She
        joins Burke watching over Gorman's shoulder as the
        Lieutenant plays the board like a video director.

        TIGHT ON MONITOR CONSOLE  REVEALING screens labelled with
        the names of the troopers.  Two for each soldier.  The
        upper screens show images from the IMAGE-INTENSIFIED
        VIDEO CAMERAS in their helmets.  The lower screens are
        BIO-MONITORS:  EEG, EKG, and other graphic life-function
        readouts.  Other screens show EXTERIOR VIEWS.

                                   GORMAN
                    Let's see.  Everybody on line.
                    Drake, check you camera.  There
                    seems to be a...

        CLOSE ON DRAKE  as he whacks himself on the head with
        an ammo case.  A familiar malfunction.

                                   GORMAN
                           (o.s)
                    ...that's better.  Pan it around
                    a bit.

                                   APONE
                    Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up.
                    Let's move.  Two minutes.
                    Somebody wake up Hicks.

        A clatter of activity as they don backpacks and weapons.
        Vasquez and Drake buckle on their smart-gun body
        harnesses.

        Ripley watches the AP station loom on the exterior
        screens.

                                   RIPLEY
                    That the atmosphere processor?

                                   BURKE
                    Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so,
                    all over the planet.  They're
                    completely automated.  We
                    manufacture them, by the way.

        EXT. SHIP - AP STATION                                   51

        The tiny ship circles the roaring tower.  A metal
        volcano thundering like the engines on God's Lear jet.

        INT. HOLD - APC                                          52

        Gorman plays with the controls, zooming the image of
        the colony.

                                   GORMAN
                           (to Ferro via mike)
                    Hold at forty.  Slow circle of
                    the complex.

                                   RIPLEY                                   
                    The structure seems intact.  They
                    have power.

        On the screen the colony buildings loom in and the low
        visibility like wrecks of freighters on the sea floor.

                                   GORMAN
                           (to Apone)
                    Okay, let's do it.

                                   APONE
                    Awright!  I want a nice clean
                    dispersal this time.

        Ripley turns as Vasquez squeezes past her.

                                   VASQUEZ
                    You staying in here?

                                   RIPLEY
                    You bet.

                                   VASQUEZ
                           (turning away)
                    Figures.

                                   GORMAN
                           (to Ferro via mike)
                    Set down sixty meters this side
                    of the telemetry mast.  Immediate
                    dust off on my 'clear,' then stay
                    on station.

                                   APONE
                    Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!

        EXT. COLONY COMPLEX                                      53

        Landing beacons sweep harsh light across the wet Tarmac.
        The ship roars down, extending the loading ramp.  Slams
        down on hydraulic LANDING LEGS.  The APC hits the ground
        a moment later, pulling away from the ship as it leaps
        up in a cloud of spray and peels off, circling.

        The APC pulls to the edge of the complex.  The CREW DOOR
        opens.  Troopers hit the ground running.  Spread out.
        They drop behind immediate cover.  Apone scans with
        him image intensifier visor lowered.

        APONE'S P.O.V.  through the starlight-scope visor.
        Bright as a sunny day, though contrasty and lurid, we
        SEE the colony buildings.  Trash blows in the street.
        No other movement.

                                   GORMAN
                           (voice over;
                           filtered)
                    First squad up, on line.  Hicks,
                    get yours in a cordon.  Watch the
                    rear.

                                   APONE
                    Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.

        Sprinting in a skirmish line, Apone's team advances on
        the colony main entry-lock.  Parked tightly across the
        doors are two heavy-duty tractors.  Vasquez reaches one
        of the tractors, looks inside.  The controls are ripped
        out, as if by a crowbar or axe.  She moves on.

        EXT. COLONY BUILDING                                     54

        Vasquez reaches the main doors, Drake flanking on the
        right.  Apone tries the door controls.  Nothing.

                                   APONE
                    Sealed.  Hudson, run a bypass.

        Hudson, all business now, moves up and studies the
        door control panel.  He pries off the facing and starts
        clipping on the bypass wires.

                                   APONE
                    First squad, assemble on me at
                    the main lock.

        The wind roars around the bleak structures.  A neon sign
        creaks overhead.  Hudson makes a connection.  The door
        shrieks in its tracks and rumbles aside.  It jams
        partway open.  Apone motions Vasquez inside.  She
        eases over the wrecked tractor, through the doors.
        The others follow.

                                   GORMAN
                           (voice over;
                           filtered)
                    Second team, move up.
                    Flanking positions.

        INT. COLONY - MAIN CONCOURSE                             55

        DOLLYING SLOWLY FORWARD, following Vasquez and Apone as
        they move into the broad corridor.  A few emergency
        lights are still on.  Wind moans along the concourse.
        Pools of water cover the floor.  Farther down, rain drips
        through blast holes in the ceiling.  Evidence of a
        fire fight with pulse-rifles.

        ON VASQUEZ  moving forward.  Taut.  Alert.  Her smart-gun
        cannon swinging slowly in an arc.  She studies the
        video aiming monitor, looking down rather than ahead.
        Their footsteps echo.

        INT. APC                                                 56

        Ripley watches as the bobbing images reveal the empty
        colony building.

                                   GORMAN
                    Quarter and search by twos.  Second
                    team move inside.  Hicks, take the
                    upper level.  Use your motion
                    trackers.

        INT. MAIN CONCOURSE - SECOND LEVEL                       57

        Hicks leads his squad up the stairwell to second level.
        They emerge cautiously.  An empty corridor recedes into
        the dim distance.  Hicks unslings a rugged piece of
        equipment.  Aims it down the hall.  He adjusts the
        "gain."  It remains silent.

                                   HICKS
                    Nothing.  No movement.

        They pass rooms and offices.  Through doors they see
        increasing signs of struggle.  Furniture overturned.
        Papers scattered...floating sodden in the puddles.

        INT. APC                                                 58

        Ripley et al watching.

                                   BURKE
                    Looks like my room in college.

        Nobody laughs.

        INT. SECOND LEVEL                                        59

        Hicks' group passes several burnt-out rooms.  There are
        no bodies.  In several offices the exterior windows are
        blown out, admitting wind and rain.  Hicks picks up a
        half-eaten donut beside a coffee cup overflowing with
        rainwater.

        INT. LOWER LEVEL - QUARTERS                              60

        Apone's men are searching systematically in pairs.  They
        pass through the colonists' modest apartments, little
        more than cubicles.  Hudson, on tracker, flanks Vasquez
        as they move forward.  Hudson touches a splash of color
        on the wall.  Dried blood.  His tracker BEEPS.

        Vasquez whirls, cannon aimed.  The BEEPING grows more
        frequent as Hudson advances toward a half open door.  The
        door is splintered partway out of its frame.  Holes
        caused by pulse-rifle rounds pepper the walls.  Vasquez
        eases up to the door.  Kicks it in.  Tenses to fire.

        Inside, dangling from a piece of flex conduit, a
        junction-box swings like a pendulum in the wind from a
        broken window.  It clanks against the rails of a child's
        bunkbed as it swings.

        INT. DROP-SHIP - APC                                     61

        Ripley watches Hicks' monitor.

                    There!

        TIGHT ON MONITOR  as the image shifts, revealing a
        section of wall corroded almost through in an irregular
        pattern.

        TIGHT ON RIPLEY  knowing what it is.

                                   HICKS

        Burke raises an eyebrow at Ripley.

                                   BURKE
                    Hmm.  Acid for blood.

                    one of Ripley's bad guys here.

        INT. FIRST LEVEL                                         62

        Hudson is looking at something.

                    Hey, if you like that, you're gonna
                    love this...

        WIDER ANGLE  showing the trooper standing beneath a
        gaping hole.  Another hole, directly beneath, is at his
        feet.  The acid has melted right down through two levels
        into the maintenance level.  Revealing pipes, conduit,
        equipment...eaten away by the ferocious substance.

                           (cupping his mike)
                    He's coming in.  I feel safer
                    already.

        EXT. COLONY COMPLEX                                      65

        Lights arc across the dormant buildings as the APC turns
        onto the "main drag."  It trundles down the rutted
        street, throwing up sheets of filthy water as the
        massive wheels hit pondlike potholes.  Windblown rain
        lashes across the headlights.

        Hicks emerges from the south lock just as the APC rolls
        up close to the entrance.  The crew-door slides back.
        Gorman emerges, followed by Burke, Bishop, and
        Wierzbowski.  Burke looks back to see Ripley stop in the
        APC doorway, eyeing the ominous colony structure.  She
        meets his eyes.  Shakes her head "no."  Not ready.

                                   HUDSON
                           (voice over;

                    Sir, the CPU is on-line.

                                   GORMAN
                    Okay, stand by in operations.
                           (to those present)
                    Let's go.

        INT. APC                                                 66

        The crew-door cycles home with a clang.  Ripley sits in
        the dark interior, lit by the tactical displays.  The
        wind howls outside, an incredibly desolate sound.  She
        hugs herself.  Alone.  Unarmed.  She knows she's in a
        tank, but remembers the acid.  Leaps up.  Hits the door
        switch.

        EXT. APC - SOUTH LOCK                                    67

        The crew-door opens and Ripley emerges.  In time to see
        the lock doors rumbling closed.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (shouting)
                    Burke!

        The wind snatches her words away.  The crew door whines
        shut behind her.  She walks to the exterior lock
        door-controls and studies them.  She punches some
        unfamiliar buttons.  Nothing happens.  She looks really
        nervous, alone in the howling wind.  She hits another
        button.  The door-motors come to life and she relaxes
        a little.  Glances behind her.  AND SCREAMS!  There's
        a face right there!  Right at her shoulder.  She jumps
        back, gasping for breath.

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                    Scare you?

                                   RIPLEY
                    Christ, Wierzbowski!

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                    Sorry.  Hicks said to keep an
                    eye on you.

        He gestures for her to precede him inside.

        INT. CONTROL BLOCK CORRIDOR                              68

        Ripley catches up with the others as they move into the
        bowels of the complex.

                                   GORMAN
                           (to Burke)
                    Looks like you company can write
                    off its share of this colony.

                                   BURKE
                           (unconcerned)
                    It's insured.

        ON RIPLEY  as they move along the corridor...reacting to
        the fact that she is back in alien country.  She sees
        the ravaged administration complex.  Fire-gutted offices.
        Hicks notices her looking around nervously.  He motions
        to big Wierzbowski with his eyes and the trooper casually
        falls in beside her on the other side, rifle at ready.
        a two-man protective cordon.  She glances at Hicks.  He
        winks, but so fast maybe it's something in his eye.

        Trooper Frost emerges from a side corridor ahead.

                                   FRONT
                    Sir, you should check this out...

        He leads the way into the corridor.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                            69

        This wing is completely without power.  The troopers
        switch on their pack lights and the beams illuminate
        a scene of devastation worse than they have seen.  Her
        expression reveals that Ripley is about to turn and flee.

                                   FROST
                    Right ahead here...

        They approach a barricade blocking the corridor, a
        hastily welded wall of pipes, steel-plate, outer-door
        panels.  Acid holes have slashed through the floor and
        walls in several places.  The metal is scratched and
        twisted by hideously powerful forces, peeled back like
        a soup can on one side.  They squeeze through the
        opening.

        INT. MEDICAL WING                                        70

        They pack-lights play over the devastation of the
        colonists' last ditch battle.  The equipment of the med
        labs has been uprooted to add to the barrier.  The walls
        are perforated by pulse-rifle fire and acid.  Scorched
        by untended fires to bare metal.  A few instruments glow
        with emergency power.

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                    Last stand.

                                   GORMAN
                    No bodies?

                                   FROST
                    No, Sir.  Looks like it was a
                    helluva fight.

        TIGHT ON RIPLEY  transfixed by something.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (low)
                    Over there.

        The others turn and approach, seeing what she sees.  She
        has entered a second room, part of the med lab area.  In
        a storage alcove at near eye level stand seven
        transparent cylinders.  STASIS TUBES.  They glow faintly
        with an eerie violet light given off by the field which

        preserves the specimens inside.

        They look like jars containing SEVERED ARTHRITIC HANDS,
        the palsied fingers curled in a death-rictus.
        Structurally they are more like spiders with sickening
        translucent skin, a flacid scrotal body, gill-like
        organs underneath drifting in the suspension fluid.
        Something you definitely do not want on your face, for
        example.

                                   BURKE
                    Are these the same...?

        Ripley nods, unable to speak.  Burke leans closer in
        fascination.  His face almost touching one cylinder, is
        lit by its glow.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Watch it, Burke...

        The creature inside lunges suddenly, slamming against
        the glass.  Burke jumps back.  From the palm of the
        thing's handlike body emerges a pearl-escent TUBULE.
        like a tapered piece of intestine, which slithers
        tonguelike over the inside of the glass.  Then it
        retracts into a sheath between the "gills."

                                   HICKS
                           (to Burke)
                    It likes you.

        Only two of the creatures seem to pulse with life.
        Burke taps the other stasis cylinders but the
        hand-things remain inertly clenched.

                                   BURKE
                    These are dead.  There's just
                    the two alive.

        On top of each cylinder is a file folder.  Ripley takes
        a folder from above one of the live specimens.  Inside
        is a medical chart printout with handwritten entries.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (reading)
                    Removed surgically before embryo
                    implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk,
                    John L.   Died during procedure.
                           (looking up)
                    They killed him getting it off.

                                   HICKS
                    Poor bastard.

        They are startled by a LOUD BEEP.  They turn.  Hicks
        is intent on his motion tracker, aimed back toward the
        shattered barricade.  BEEP.  BEEP.

                                   HICKS
                    Behind us.

        He gestures at the corridor they just passed through.

                                   RIPLEY
                    One of us?

                                   GORMAN
                           (into headset)
                    Apone...where are your people?
                    Anybody in D-Block?

                                   APONE
                           (voice over; filtered)
                    Negative.  We're all in Operations.

        Vasquez swings the smart-gun to ready position on
        its support arm, locking it with an authoritative
        CLICK.  She and Hicks head toward the source of the
        signal, the others following.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                            71

        Hicks' tracker is reading out more rapidly.  They
        turn into the kitchens, a stainless steel labyrinth.

        Ripley hangs back.  Then realizes there is nothing
        behind her but darkness.  She catches up to the group.


        INT. KITCHENS                                            72

        The troopers enter, their lights bouncing around the
        stainless steel surfaces.

                                   HICKS
                    It's moving.

        Vasquez is scanning, gaze intense.  The other troops
        grip their weapons tightly.

                                   VASQUEZ
                    Which way?

        Hicks nods toward a complicated array of food

        processing equipment.  They move forward, weapons
        leveled.

        Ripley shuffles forward in the dark.  Wierzbowski
        trips over a metal cannister, sending it CLANGING.
        Ripley half climbs the wall.

        Hicks' tracker beeps steadily.  The beeps merge.
        Become a solid tone.  CRASH.  Something moves in the
        dark, toppling a rack of stockpots.

        ON VASQUEZ  pivoting smoothly to fire.  In the same
        instant Hicks' rifle slashes INTO FRAME.  Slams
        Vasquez' barrel upward.  A STREAM OF TRACER FIRE rips
        into the ceiling, the rounds SEARING LIKE LIGHTNING.

                                   VASQUEZ
                    You fuck!

        Hicks ignores her, moving past and aiming his light
        under a row of steel cabinets.  He gestures to Ripley,
        who steps forward.  Trusting his judgment.  She
        crouches beside him.

        RIPLEY'S P.O.V.  lit by Hicks' pack-light...a tiny
        cowering figure.  A very dirty, very terrified
        NEWT JORDEN.  She clutches a plastic food packet in
        one hand, its top gnawed partway through.  In the other
        hand she grips the HEAD OF A LARGE DOLL, holding it by
        the hair.  Just the head.  Eyes staring.  Newt is
        pathetically emaciated...fragile-looking as Dresden
        china, her hair tangled and matted.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (soothingly)
                    Come on out.  It's all right...

        Ripley moves toward her, reaching slowly under the
        cabinet.  Newt backs away, trembling visibly, her
        vision fixated like a rabbit blinded by headlights.
        Ripley's hand almost reaches her.

        The kid bolts like a shot, scuttling along beneath the
        cabinetry.  Ripley scrambles to follow...to keep her
        in sight.  Crabbing frantically sideways.  Hicks makes
        a grab, catching one tiny ankle.  He snaps his hand
        out a moment later.

                                   HICKS
                    Ow!  Shit.  Watchit, she bites.

        The girl reaches a ventilation duct set in the
        baseboard, its grille kicked out.  She scrambles
        inside, her tiny body barely fitting, wriggling like
        a fish.

        In his bulky armor Hicks knows he'll never make it
        into the tiny duct.  Ripley dives.  She squirms into
        the duct without thinking.  Just ahead she sees Newt
        enter a dark space and slam a steel hatch.  Ripley
        pushes the hatch open before the child can latch it,
        and crawls in after her.


        Newt is backed into a cul-de-sac in the tiny steel
        chamber.  Ripley shines her light around in amazement.
        It is a NEST.  A nest built by a child.  Wadded up
        blankets and pillows line the space, mixed up with a
        haphazard array of TOYS, STUFFED ANIMALS, DOLLS, CHEAP
        JEWELRY, COMIC BOOKS, EMPTY FOOD PACKETS, even a
        battery operated TAPE PLAYER.  All foraged from the
        wrecked colony.  Ripley marvels at the child's
        incredible adaptability, the ability to functions even
        in this nightmarish environment.

        Newt edges along the far wall and dives for the hatch.

        Ripley grabs her, controlling her in a bear hug.  The
        kid struggles wildly, like a cat at the vets.  Eyes
        wide, hands lashing out in a frenzy...but silent.  No
        scream.

                                   RIPLEY
                    It's okay, it's okay.  It's over...
                    you're going to be all right now...
                    it's okay...you're safe...

        Newt goes limp, almost catatonic.

        CLOSE ON NEWT'S TRAUMATIZED, VACANT STARE  her lips
        are white and trembling, her eyes track wildly and
        she flinches from unseen terrors.  We READ a dark
        nightmare world in her eyes.

        Ripley's light falls on something amidst the debris...
        a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH of Newt, dressed up and smiling,
        a ribbon in her hair.  In embossed gold letters
        underneath it says:

                      FIRST GRADE CITIZENSHIP AWARD
                              REBECCA JORDEN

        INT. OPERATIONS - ON NEWT - MANAGER'S OFFICE             73

        sitting huddles in a chair, arms around her knees.
        Looking at a point in space.

                                   GORMAN
                           (o.s.)
                    What's her name again?

                                   DIETRICH
                           (o.s.)
                    Rebecca.

        WIDER ANGLE  REVEALING Gorman sitting in front of her
        while Dietrich watches the readouts from a
        BIO-MONITORING CUFF wrapped around Newt's tiny arm.

                                   GORMAN
                    Now think, Rebecca.
                    Concentrate.  Just start at
                    the beginning...

        No response.  Ripley enters, carrying a coffee mug.

                                   GORMAN
                    Where are your parents?  You
                    have to try...

                                   RIPLEY
                           (sharply)
                    Gorman!  Give it a rest would
                    you.

        Gorman stands with a sigh of dismissal.

                                   GORMAN
                    Total brain-lock.

                                   DIETRICH
                           (shrugs)
                    Physically she's okay.
                    Borderline malnutrition, but
                    I don't think any permanent
                    damage.

        She unsnaps the bio-monitoring cuff.

                                   GORMAN
                    Come on, we're wasting our
                    time.

        Gorman and the others exit, leaving only Ripley with
        Newt.  Through the window of the office, out on the
        main floor of the operations room, we SEE Gorman
        join Burke and Bishop at a computer terminal.

        Ripley kneels beside Newt, brushing the girl's unkempt
        hair out of her eyes in a gentle, maternal fashion.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Here, try this.  A little
                    instant hot chocolate.

        She wraps the child's hands around the cup.  Raises
        it to her lips for her.  The girl drinks mechanically,
        spilling down her chin.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (soothing)
                    Poor thing.  You don't talk
                    much do you?  That's okay by
                    me.  Most people do a lot of
                    talking and they wind up not
                    saying very much.

        She sets the cup down and wipes the child's chin clean.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Uh oh.  I made a clean spot
                    here.  Now I've done it.  Guess
                    I'll just have to do the whole
                    thing.

        She pours water from a squeeze bottle onto a small
        cloth and gently washes the little girl's face.
        Newt's eyes seem to focus on her for the first time.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Hard to believe...there's a
                    little girl under all this.
                    And a pretty one at that.

        Newt gazes at her.  Ripley smiles.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                          74

        The ground teams are gathered around a terminal in
        the computer center.  Hudson has the CPU main computer
        on-line and reading out.

        TIGHT ON MONITOR SCREEN  as an abstract of the main

        Hudson bashes at the keyboard, his fingers dancing
        expertly.

        INT. OFFICE                                              75

        Ripley is washing Newt's tiny hands with a cloth,
        pink skin emerging from black grime.

                                   RIPLEY
                    I don't know how you managed
                    to stay alive but you're one
                    brave kid, Rebecca.

        Newt's voice is almost inaudible.

                                   NEWT
                    N-newt.

        Ripley leans closer.  Feels like she's breathing
        on coals.  The sound was incomprehensible.

                                   RIPLEY
                    What did you say?

                                   NEWT
                    Newt.  My n-name's Newt.
                    Nobody calls me Rebecca except
                    my dork brother.

        Ripley grins inanely, not wanting to move or speak...
        or break the spell.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Well, Newt it is then.  My
                   name's Ripley...and people
                   call me Ripley.

        Ripley picks up her tiny limp hand, shaking it
        formally.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Pleased to meet you.  And who
                   is this?  Does she have a
                   name?

        Newt glances at the disembodied doll, still clutched
        in one filthy hand.

                                  NEWT
                   Casey.  She's my only friend.

                                  RIPLEY
                   What about me?

        Newt's reply is flat, neutral.

                                  NEWT
                   I don't want you for a friend.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Why not?

                                  NEWT 
                   Because you'll be gone soon,
                   like the others.  Like
                   everybody.  You'll be dead
                   and you'll leave me alone.

        Ripley gazes at her, chilled both by the ominous
        statement and by the situation which could have
        produced this outlook in a child.

                                  RIPLEY

                   Oh, Newt.  You mom and dad
                   went away like that, didn't
                   they?
        
        Newt nods, staring at her knees.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (soothingly)
                   They'd be here if they could,
                   honey.  I know they would.

                                  NEWT
                          (with cold certainty)
                   They're dead.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I
                   won't leave you.  I promise.

                                  NEWT
                   You promise?

                                  RIPLEY
                   Cross my heart.

                                  NEWT
                   And hope to die?

        Ripley smiles grimly at the inadvertently macabre
        expression.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (quietly)
                   And hope to die.

        And because she's a child, the darkest terrors, even
        the ones seen and not imagined, can still be banished
        by a smile and a single promise.

        Newt's eyes brim as she gazes at Ripley.  Her lower
        lip starts to tremble, and her face slowly deforms
        into an abject mask.  She sobs as she clamps her arms
        around Ripley's neck.  The sobs come in waves as
        Ripley rocks her, tears of suppresses terror and
        grief and hurt rolling down her face.  It is a
        breakthrough.

        Ripley closes her eyes, hoping that this promise
        can be kept.

        Everyone jumps as Hudson cries out triumphantly.

                   'C' under the south tower.

        EXT. ACHERON - TWILIGHT                                  77

        The APC roars across the stygian landscape, traversing
        the causeway which connects the colony to the
        ATMOSPHERE STATION a kilometer away.  Behind it the
        drop-ship settles to the ground at the colony landing
        field.

        PAN WITH THE APC TO REVEAL the massive structure.
        Like a vast foundry the conical exhaust tower
        flickers with spectral light.

        INT. APC                                                 78

        The troopers sit, more subdued now, swaying and
        bouncing in the heavily sprung vehicle.  Wierzbowski
        is in the saddle.  Ripley and Newt sit side by side
        just aft of the driver's cockpit.

                                  NEWT
                   I was the best at the game.
                   I knew the whole maze.

                                  RIPLEY
                   The 'maze'?  You mean the
                   air ducts?

                                  NEWT
                   Yeah, you know.  In the walls,
                   under the floor.  I was the
                   ace.  I could hide better
                   than anybody.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You're really something, ace.

        Ripley's gaze shifts out the windshield as the
        processing station looms ahead.

        EXT. APC/STATION                                         79

        The vast structure towers above the parked personnel
        carrier.  Deploying in front of the APC, backlit by
        its lights, the troopers cast long shadows.  They
        look ominous.  Hulking techno-samurai.

        The base of the station is a depthless maze of
        conduits and pressure vessels, like an oil refinery.
        Or a Dantean version of one.  The THRUM of
        functioning machine systems echoes through the
        labyrinth.

        The troopers start down the open rampway.  Light
        filters down through several levels of steel mesh
        floor, catwalks and pipes.  Below that is darkness.

        Huddles around the screens are Ripley, Burke and
        Gorman.  Newt squeezes in from behind.  Gorman is
        doing his video wizard bit, dancing on the buttons.

        INT. COMPLEX                                             81

        The group stands before a bizarre tableau.  Among
        the refinerylike lattice of pipes and conduits
        something new and not of human design had been
        added.

        It is a structure of some sort, extending from and
        crudely imitating the complex of plumbing, but made
        of some strange encrusted substance.  It vaguely
        resembles the chambered nests of swallows on a much
        larger scale, and it attenuates so gradually into
        the original hardware that it is hard to see where
        one ends and the other begins.

        The alien structure seems to extend far back into
        the complex of machinery.  The plant thrums loudly,
        its functioning seemingly not impaired.

        INT. APC                                                 82

        Ripley stares at the scene in dread fascination.

                   What is it?

        They enter the organic labyrinth, playing their
        lights over the walls.  Revealing a BIO-MECHANICAL
        LATTICE, like the marrow of some vast bone.  The air
        is thick with STEAM.  Trickling water.  The place
        seems almost alive.

        Steam swirls around them as the troopers move deeper
        inside.

        Ripley leans forward suddenly, studying the graphic
        readout of the STATION GROUND PLAN.

                                  RIPLEY
                   They're right under the
                   primary heat exchangers.

                                  BURKE
                   Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like
                   the heat, that's why they built...

                                  RIPLEY
                   That's not what I mean.  Gorman,
                   if your men have to use their
                   weapons in there, they'll rupture
                   the cooling system.

                                  BURKE
                          (realizing)
                   She's right.

                   So.

                                  RIPLEY
                   So...then the fusion
                   containment shuts down.

                                  GORMAN
                          (impatient)
                   So?  So?

                                  BURKE
                   We're talking thermonuclear
                   explosion.

                                  GORMAN
                   Shit.
                          (into
                          mike)
                   Apone, collect magazines
                   from everybody.  We can't
                   have any firing in there.

        INT. ALIEN STRUCTURE                                     87

        The troopers look at each other in dismay.

                                  WIERZBOWSKI
                   Is he fucking crazy?

                                  HUDSON
                   What're we supposed to use,
                   man?  Harsh language?

                                  GORMAN
                          (voice over; static)
                   Flame-units only.  I want
                   rifles slung.

                                  APONE
                   Let's go.  Pull 'em out.

        He walks among the troopers, collecting the magazines
        from each one's weapon.

        Vasquez turns hers over reluctantly.

        The three who are carrying them get out small
        incinerator units.  When Apone moves on, Vasquez
        slips a spare magazine from concealment and inserts
        it in her weapon.  Drake does the same.  Hicks hangs
        back in the shadows.  He opens a cylindrical sheath
        attached to his battle-harness.  Slides out an
        old style PUMP TWELVE-GAUGE with a sawed-off butt
        stock.  Chambers a round.


                                  HICKS
                          (low,
                          to Hudson)
                   I always keep this handy.
                   For close encounter.

                                  APONE

                          (o.s.)
                   Let's move.  Hicks, back
                   us up.

        INT. LARGER CHAMBER                                      88

        The air is thick.  Lights flare.

                                  GORMAN
                          (voice over;
                          very faint)
                   Any movement?

        Hudson watches his tracker, scanning.

                                  HUDSON
                   Nothing.  Zip.

        Apone stops, his expression changing.  They face a
        wall of living horror.  The colonists have been
        brought here and entombed alive...

        COCOONS protrude from the niches and interstices
        of the structure.  The cocoon material is the same
        translucent epoxy.  The bodies are frozen in
        carelessly twisted positions.  Macabre image of
        frozen agony.  Many are disiccated.  Skeletal.
        Rip-cages burst outward, as if exploded from within.
        Paralyzed, brought here, entombed in living death
        as hosts for the embryos growing within then.

        Dietrich moves close to examine one of the figures,
        perhaps the most "recent."  A WOMAN, ghost-white
        and drained.  The WOMAN'S EYES SNAP OPEN...They
        seem to plead.

                                  DIETRICH
                   Sir!

        The woman's lips move feebly.

                                  WOMAN
                   Please...God...kill me.

        INT. APC                                                 89

        Ripley watches the woman, white knuckled.  The
        sound of RETCHING comes over the general frequency.

        INT. COCOON CHAMBER                                      90

        The woman begins to convulse.  She SCREAMS, a
        sawing shriek of mindless agony.

                                  APONE
                   Flame thrower!  Move!

        Frost hands it to him.  Suddenly, the woman's chest
        EXPLODES in a gout of blood.  A SMALL FANGED HEAD
        EMERGES, HISSING VICIOUSLY.

        Apone pulls the trigger.  Then the other troopers
        carrying flame throwers open fire.  An orgy of
        purging fire.  The cocoons vanish in the shimmering
        heat.

        A SHRILL SCREECHING begins, like a siren made from
        fingernails on blackboards.

        ANGLE ON WALL  as something begins to emerge.  Dimly
        glimpsed, a glistening bio-mechanoid creature larger
        then a man.  Lying dormant, it had blended perfectly
        with the convoluted surface of fused bone.  The
        troopers don't see it.  Smoke from the burning cocoons
        quickly fills the confined space.  Visibility drops
        to zero.

                                  HUDSON
                   Movement!

                                  APONE
                   Position?

                                  HUDSON
                   Can't lock up...

                                  APONE
                          (with an edge)
                   Talk to me, Hudson.

                                  HUDSON
                   Uh, seems to be in front
                   and behind.

        INT. APC                                                 91

        Gorman is plating with the gain controls on the
        monitors.

                                  GORMAN
                   We can't see anything back
                   here, Apone.  What's going on?

        Ripley senses it coming, like a wave at night.  Dark,
        terrifying and inevitable.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (low)
                   Pull you team out, Gorman.

        INT. COCOON CHAMBER - TIGHT ON SEVERAL WALLS AND         92
        CEILING NICHES

        as they come alive.  Bonelike, tubelike shapes shift,
        becoming emerging ALIENS.  Dimly glimpsed...glints
        of slime.  Silhouettes.

                                  APONE
                   Go to infrared.  Looks sharp
                   people!

        The squad members snap down their image-intersifier
        visors.

                                  HUDSON
                   Multiple signals.  All round.
                   Closing.

        Dietrich turns to retreat, her flamethrower held
        tightly.  A nightmarish silhouette materializes out
        of the smoke behind her!  It strikes like lightning.
        SEIZES HER.  She fires reflexively, wild.  The jet
        of flame engulfs Frost nearby.

        Apone spins as the double SCREAM.  Can't see anything
        in the think smoke.

        INT. APC                                                 93

        Ripley watches Frost's monitor go black.  His
        bio-readouts flatten.  The other screens show glimpses
        of shimmering infrared silhouettes of the aliens, the
        images bobbing and panning confusedly.

        INT. COCOON CHAMBER                                      94

        Vasquez nods to Drake with grim satisfaction.

                                  VASQUEZ
                   Let's rock.

        They OPEN UP simultaneously, lighting up the smoke
        like welders' arcs.

                                  GORMAN
                          (voice over; static)
                   Who's firing?  I ordered a
                   hold fire, dammit!

        Vasquez rips off her headset.  She is riveted to the
        targetting screen, moving ferret-quick in a pivoting
        dance.  Thunder and lightning.  Better than sex for
        her.  FLASH-CRACK!  An alien SCREECH from the darkness.

        INT. APC                                                 95

        The battle of phantoms unfolds on the video screens.
        Ripley flinches as another scream comes over the
        open frequency.  Wierzbowski's monitor breaks up.
        His life signs plummet.  Voices blend and overlap.

                                  HUDSON
                          (voice over)

                   you.  Fucking move, will you!

        Gorman is ashen.  Confused.  Gulping for air like a
        grouper.  How could the situation have unravelled
        so fast?

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to Gorman)
                   GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO
                   IT NOW!

                                  GORMAN
                   Shut up.  Just shut up!

        CRASH!  Crowe's telemetry cuts off like the plug was
        pulled.  Flat line.

                                  GORMAN
                   Uh,...Apone, I want you to
                   lay down a suppressing fire
                   with the incinerators and
                   fall back by squads to the
                   APC, over.

                                  APONE
                          (voice over;
                          heavy static)
                   Say again?  All after
                   incinerators?

        Ripley watches it fall apart.

                                  GORMAN
                   I said...

        INT. COCOON CHAMBER                                      96

        Apone adjusts his headset.

                                  GORMAN
                          (voice over;
                          static)
                   ...lay down (garbled) ...by
                   squads to...(garbled)

        Gorman's voice breaks up completely.  A SCREAM.
        Apone whirls, uncertain.

                                  APONE
                   Dietrich?  Crowe?  Sound
                   off!  Wierzbowski?

        Nothing.  He spins.  Almost blows Hudson's head
        off.

                                  HUDSON
                          (freaked)
                   We're getting juked!  We're
                   gonna die in here!

        Apone hands him a magazine.  Hudson slaps it home,
        looking truly terrified.

                                  APONE
                   Yeah.  Right.  Right!  Fuck
                   the heat exchanger!

        He FIRES.  Vasquez, nearby, is laying down a
        horrendous field of fire.  Strobe-bright flashes
        sear the darkness.  She pivots, firing mechanically
        in controlled bursts.  Scoring points in her own
        private video game.

        She SPINS as Hicks approached laterally.  WHAM!  She
        fires "at" him.  Hicks whirls...to see a nightmarish
        figure right behind him, catapulted backwards by
        Vasquez' blast.

        INT. APC                                                 97

        Apone's monitor SPINS CRAZILY AND GOES DARK.

                                  GORMAN
                          (distantly)
                   I told them to fall back...

                                  RIPLEY
                          (viciously)
                   They're but off!  Do something!

        But he's gone.  Total brain-lock.

        TIGHT ON RIPLEY  as she struggles with a decision.
        She's terrified...of what she knows she's about to
        do.  But more than that, she's furious.  Shouldering
        past a paralyzed Gorman she runs up the aisle of the
        APC.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (in passing)
                   Newt, put your seatbelt on!

        Ripley jumps into the driver's seat of the APC.  Takes
        a deep breath.  Starts slapping switches.

                                  GORMAN
                   Ripley, what the hell...?

        She slams the tractor into gear.

        EXT. APC                                                 98

        as the drive-wheels spin on the wet ground.  The
        massive machine leaps forward.

        INT. APC                                                 99

        Ripley sees smoke pouring out of the complex ahead
        as she slides sideways onto the descending rampway.
        She slams the left and right drive-wheel actuators
        viciously, spinning the machine in a roaring pivot.
        Gorman lunges forward along the aisle, abandoning
        his command center.

                                  GORMAN
                          (shrill)
                   What are you doing?  Turn
                   around!  That's an order!

        He claws at her, hysterical.  Burke pulls him off.

        INT. ALIEN STRUCTURE                                    100

        The APC roars down into the smoky structure, tearing
        away outcroppings of alien-encrustation.  Ripley hits
        the floodlights.  Strobe-beacon.  Siren.  She homes
        on the flash of weapons fire ahead.

        INT. COCOON CHAMBER                                     101

        The APC crashes inside, showering debris.  Hicks,
        supporting a limping Hudson, appears out of the smoke.
        The APC pulls up broadside and Burke gets the crew-door
        open.

        Drake and Vasquez back out of the dense mist, firing as
        they fall back.

        Drake goes empty, slams the buckles cutting loose his
        smart-gun harness, and unslings a flame thrower.

        Hicks pushes Hudson inside, leaps in after him and
        drags Vasquez inside, massive gear and all.  She sees
        a DARK SHAPE lunge toward Drake.  She fires one burst,
        prone.  Clean body hit.

        The flash lights up the hideous inhuman grin, blowing
        open the thing's thorax.  A spray of BRIGHT YELLOW
        ACID slashes across Drake's face and chest, eating
        into him like a hot knife through butter.  He drops
        in boiling smoke, reflexively triggering his flame
        thrower.

        The jet of liquid fire arcs around as he falls,
        engulfing the back half of the APC.

        INT. APC                                                102

        Vasquez rolls aside as a gout of napalm shoots
        through the crew-door, setting the interior on fire.
        Hicks is rolling the door closed when Vasquez lunges,
        clawing out the opening.  He stops her, dragging her
        inside.

                                  VASQUEZ
                   Drake!  He's down!

        Hicks screams right in her face.

                                  HICKS
                   He's gone!  Forget it, he's
                   gone!

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (irrational)
                   No.. No, he's not.  He's --

        Burke and Hudson help him drag her from the door.

                                  HICKS
                          (to Ripley)
                   Let's go!

        Ripley jams reverse.  Nails the throttle.  The APC
        bellows backward up the ramp.  Hudson disappears
        under a pile of equipment as a storage rack breaks
        free.  Hicks gets the door almost closed.  Suddenly
        CLAWS appear at the edge.  Newt screams.  Against
        the combined efforts of Hicks, Burke and Vasquez
        the door is being SLOWLY WRENCHED OPEN FROM OUTSIDE.
        Hicks yells at a paralyzed Gorman.

                                  HICKS
                   Get on the Goddamn door!

        Gorman backs away, eyes wide.  Hicks jams his shoulder
        against the latching lever and frees one hand to raise
        his 12-gauge.  An alien head wedges through the opening,
        its hideous mouth opening.  And Hicks jams his SHOTGUN
        MUZZLE between its jaws and pulls the trigger!  BLAM!
        The creature is flung backward, its shattered head
        fountaining acid blood.  The spray eats into the door,
        the deck, hits Hudson on the arm.  He shrieks.  They
        slide the door home and dog it tight.

        EXT. APC                                                103

        The armored vehicle roars backward up the ramp.  Slams
        into a mass of conduit.  Tears free.  Ripley works the
        shifters, pivoting the massive machine.  Everybody's
        shouting, trying to put out the fire.  Pandemonium.

        INT./EXT. APC                                           104-
                                                                105

        Something lands on the roof with a metallic clang.

        Gorman has plastered himself against a wall, as far
        from the door as possible.  A latch lever behind his
        head turns.  The small hatch against which he was
        leaning is ripped away and SOMETHING snatches him out
        the opening  He disappears to the waist with a shriek,
        legs kicking.  The alien clings to the roof, pulling
        him out.  Its tail whips over, scorpionlike, and
        buries a four inch stinger in Gorman's shoulder.
        Hicks grabs a joy stick at the FIRE-CONTROL CONSOLE
        and turns it rapidly.  On the roof the alien looks up
        as servo-motors whir.  A remote control turret cannon,
        a 20mm chain-gun, swivels toward it in a curt arc.
        VOOM.  The creature is blasted off the vehicle's
        armored back and tumbles away.  Gorman, slumped
        unconscious, is dragged back inside.

        The APC rips away a section of catwalk and heads for
        clear air, its flank trailing fire like a comet.
        Ripley fights the controls as the big machine slews,
        broadsiding a control-room out-building.  Office
        furniture and splintered wall sections are strewn in
        the APC's wake.

        Suddenly, an alien arm arcs down, right in front of
        Ripley's face.  It smashes the windshield.  Glistening,
        hideous jaws lunge inside...

        Ripley recoils.  Face to face once again with the same
        mind-numbing horror.  She reacts instinctively.  Slams
        both sets of brakes with all her strength.  The huge
        wheels lock.  The creature flips off, landing in the
        headlights.  Ripley hits full throttle.  The APC roars
        forward, smashing over the abomination.  Its skeletal
        body is crushed under the massive wheels.  It rolls,
        tumbling...lost in the darkness behind as the machine
        thunders onto the causeway and away from the station.

        A sound like bolts dropped in a meat grinder is coming
        from the APC's rear end.  Hicks eases Ripley's hand
        back on the throttle lever.  Her grip is white knuckled.

                                  HICKS
                   It's okay...we're clear.  We're
                   clear.  Ease up.

        The grinding clatter becomes deafening even as she
        slows the machine.

                                  HICKS
                   Sounds like a blown transaxle.
                   You're just grinding metal.

        EXT. APC                                                106

        The tractor limps to a halt.  A HALF-KILOMETER from the
        atmosphere processing station.  The APC is a smoking,
        acid-scarred mess.

        INT. APC                                                107

        Ripley, still running on the adrenalin dynamo, spins
        out of her seat into the aisle.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt?  Where's Newt?

        Feeling a tug at her pants leg she looks down.  Newt
        is wedged into a tiny space between the driver's seat
        and a bulkhead.  She is trembling, and looks terrified,
        but it's not the basket case catatonia of before.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You okay?

        Newt gives her a THUMBS-UP, wan but stoic.  Ripley goes
        back to the others.  Hudson is holding his arm and
        staring in stunned dismay at nothing, playing it all
        back in his mind.

                                  HUDSON
                   Jesus...Jesus...I don't believe
                   it.

        Burke tries to have a look at Hudson's arm.

                                  HUDSON
                          (jerking away)
                   I'm all right, leave it!

        Ripley joins Hicks who is bent over Gorman, checking
        for a pulse.

                                  HICKS
                   He's alive.  I think he's paralyzed.

                                  VASQUEZ
                   He's fucking dead!

        She grabs Gorman by the collar, hauling him up roughly,
        ready to pulp him with her other fist.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (to Gorman)
                   Wake up pendejo!  I'm gonna kill
                   you, you useless fuck!

        Hicks pushes her back.  Right in her face.

                                  HICKS
                   Hold it.  Hold it.  Back off, right
                   now.

        Vasquez releases Gorman.  His head smacks the deck.
        Ripley opens Gorman's tunic, revealing a bloodless
        purple puncture wound.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Looks like it stung him.

                                  HUDSON
                   Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and
                   Dietrich aren't dead, man.

        They turn to see Hudson at the MTOB monitors, pointing
        at the bio-function screens.

                                  HUDSON
                   They must be like Gorman.  Their
                   signs are real low but they ain't
                   dead!

        Hudson is pale, panicky, and his voice echoes around
        the tiny metallic space and comes back to all of them
        as the near hysteria they all feel, fluttering just
        at the edges of their minds.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You can't help them.  Right now
                   they're being cocooned just like
                   the others.

                                  HUDSON
                          (sagging)
                   Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't
                   happening.

        Ripley and Vasquez lock eyes.  Ripley doesn't want
        it to be "I told you so" but Vasquez reads it that
        way.  She turns away with a snap.

        INT. MED LAB                                            108

        Bishop is hunched over an occular probe doing a
        dissection of one of the dead parasites.  Spunkmeyer
        enters with some electronics gear on a hand truck
        and parks it near Bishop's work table.

                                  SPUNKMEYER
                   Need anything else?

        Bishop waves "no" without looking up.

        EXT. COLONY - DROP-SHIP                                 109

        Spunkmeyer emerges, crossing the Tarmac to the loading
        ramp of the ship.  As he nears the top of the ramp,
        his boot slips...skidding on something wet.  Kneeling,
        he touches a small puddle of thick slime.  He shrugs,
        and hits the controls to retract the ramp and close
        the doors.

        INT. APC                                                110

        ON VASQUEZ  wired and intense.

                                  VASQUEZ
                   All right, we can't blow the fuck
                   out of them...why not roll some
                   canisters of CN-20 down there.
                   Nerve gas the whole nest?

                                  HUDSON
                   Look, man, let's just bug out and
                   call it even, okay?

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to Vasquez)
                   No good.  How do we know it'll
                   effect their biochemistry?  I say
                   we take off and nuke the entire
                   site from orbit.  It's the only
                   way to be sure.

                                  BURKE
                   Now hold on a second.  I'm not
                   authorizing that action.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Why not?

        Burke senses the challenge in her tone and backpedals
        flawlessly into conciliatory mode.

                                  BURKE
                   Well, I mean...I know this is an
                   emotional moment, but let's not
                   make snap judgments.  Let's move
                   cautiously.  First, this physical
                   installation had a substantial
                   dollar value attached to it --

                                  RIPLEY
                   They can bill me.  I got a tab
                   running.  What's second?

                                  BURKE
                   This is clearly an important
                   species we're dealing with here.
                   We can't just arbitrarily
                   exterminate them --

                                  RIPLEY
                   Bullshit!

                                  VASQUEZ
                   Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us.

                                  HUDSON
                   Maybe you haven't been keeping up
                   on current events, but we just got
                   out asses kicked, pal!

        Ripley faces Burke squarely and she's not pleased.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Look, Burke.  We had an agreement.

        Burke moves in, lowering his voice.  He takes her aside
        from the others.

                                  BURKE
                   I know, I know, but we're dealing
                   with changing scenarios here.  This
                   thing is major, Ripley.  I mean
                   really major.  You gotta go with
                   its energy.  Since you are the
                   representative of the company who
                   discovered this species your
                   percentage will naturally be
                   some serious, serious money.

        Ripley stares at his like he's a particularly
        disagreeable fungus.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You son of a bitch.

                                  BURKE
                          (hardening)
                   Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.

                                  RIPLEY
                   What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks
                   has authority here.

                                  BURKE
                   Corporal Hicks!?

                                  RIPLEY
                   This operation is under military
                   jurisdiction and Hicks is next in
                   chain of command.  Right?

                                  HICKS
                   Looks that way.

        Burke starts to lose it and it's not a pretty sight.

                                  BURKE
                   Look, this is a multimillion
                   dollar operation.  He can't make
                   that kind of decision.  He's just
                   a grunt!
                          (glances at Hicks)
                   No offense.

                                  HICKS
                          (coolly)
                   None taken.
                          (into mike)
                   Ferro, you copying?

                                  FERRO
                          (voice over; static)
                   Standing by.

                                  HICKS
                   Prep for dust-off.  We're gonna
                   need an immediate evac.
                          (to Burke)
                   I think we'll take off and nuke
                   the site from orbit.  It's the
                   only way to be sure.

        He winks.  Burke looks like a kid whose toy has been
        snatched.

                                  BURKE
                   This is absurd!  You don't have
                   the authority to --

        CLACK!  The sound of a rifle bolt snapping home
        truncates his rant.  Vasquez has a pulse-rifle cradled,
        not exactly aimed at Burke but not exactly aimed away
        either.  Her expression is masklike.  End of discussion.

        Ripley sits behind Newt, putting her arm around her.

                                  RIPLEY
                   We're going home, honey.

        EXT. DROP-SHIP                                          111

        The ship rises through the spray thrown up by the
        downblast of the VTOL jets, hovering above the complex
        like a huge insect, its searchlights blazing.

        EXT. APC                                                112

        The group is filing out of the personnel carrier, which
        is clearly a write off.  Hicks and Hudson have Gorman
        between them, and the others emerge into the wind.
        They watch the ship roar in on its final approach.

        INT. DROP-SHOP COCKPIT                                  113

        Ferro flicks the intercom switch several times.  Thumps
        her headset mike.

                                  FERRO
                   Spunkmeyer?  Goddammit.

        The compartment door behind her slides slowly back.

                                  FERRO

                          (turning)
                   Where the fu --

        Her eyes widen.  It's not Spunkmeyer.

        Am impression of leering jaws which blur forward, then
        a whirl of motion and a truncated scream.  The throttle
        levers are slammed forward in the melee.

        EXT. APC - LANDSCAPE - STATION                          114

        They watch in dismay as the approaching ship dips and
        VEERS WILDLY.  Its main engines ROAR FULL ON and the
        craft accelerates toward them even as it loses altitude.
        It skims the ground.  Clips a rock formation.  The
        ship slews, sideslipping.  It hits a ridge.  Tumbles,
        bursting into flame, breaking up.  It arcs into the
        air, end over end, a Catherine wheel juggernaut.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Run!

        She grabs Newt and sprints for cover as a tumbling
        section of the ship's massive engine module slams
        into the APC and it explodes into twisted wreckage.

        The drop-ship skips again, like a stone, engulfed in
        flames...AND CRASHES INTO THE STATION.  A TREMENDOUS
        FIREBALL.

        The remainder of the ground team watches their hopes
        of getting off the planet, and most of their superior
        fire power, reduced to flaming debris.

        There is a moment of stunned silence, then...

                                  HUDSON
                          (hysterical)
                   Well that's great!  That's just
                   fucking great, man.  Now what the
                   fuck are we supposed to do, man?
                   We're in some real pretty shit now!

                                  HICKS
                   Are you finished?
                          (to Ripley)
                   You okay?

        She nods.  She can't disguise her stricken expression
        when she looks at Newt, but the little girl seems
        relatively calm.  She shrugs with fatalistic acceptance.

                                  NEWT
                   I guess we're not leaving, right?

                                  RIPLEY
                   I'm sorry, Newt.

                                  NEWT
                   You don't have to be sorry.  It
                   wasn't your fault.

                                  HUDSON
                          (kicking rocks)
                   Just tell me what the fuck we're
                   supposed to do now.  What're we
                   gonna do now?

                                  BURKE
                          (annoyed)
                   May be could build a fire and
                   sing songs.

                                  NEWT
                   We should get back, 'cause it'll
                   be dark soon.  They come mostly
                   at night.  Mostly.

        Ripley follows Newt's look to the AP station looming
        in the twilight, the burning drop-ship wreckage jammed
        into its basal structure.

        EXT. CONTROL BLOCK - NIGHT                              115

        The wind howls mournfully around the metal buildings,
        dry and cold.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         116

        The weary and demoralized group is gathered to take
        stock of their grim options.  Vasquez and Hudson are
        just setting down a scorched and dented packing case,
        one of several culled from the APC wreckage.

        Hicks indicates their remaining inventory of weapons,
        lying on a table.

                                  HICKS
                   This is all we could salvage.  We've
                   got four pulse-rifles with about
                   fifty rounds each.  Not so good.
                   About fifteen M-40 grenades and
                   two flame throwers less than
                   half full...one damaged.  And
                   We've got four of these
                   robot-sentry units with scanners
                   and display intact.

        He opens one of the scorched cases, revealing a
        high-tech servo-actuated machine gun with optical
        sensing equipment, packed in foam.

                                  RIPLEY
                   How long after we're declared
                   overdue can we expect a rescue?

                                  HICKS
                   About seventeen days.

                                  HUDSON
                   Man, we're not going to make it
                   seventeen hours!  Those things
                   are going to come in here, just
                   like they did before, man...
                   they're going to come in here
                   and get us, man, long before...

                                  RIPLEY
                   She survived longer than that
                   with no weapons and no training.

        Ripley indicates Newt, who salutes Hudson smartly.

                                  RIPLEY
                   So you better just start dealing
                   with it.  Just deal with it,
                   Hudson...because we need you and
                   I'm tired of your bullshit.  Now
                   get on a terminal and call up some
                   kind of floor plan file.
                   Construction blueprints,
                   maintenance schematics, anything
                   that shows the layout of this
                   place.  I want to see air ducts,
                   electrical access tunnels,
                   subbasements.  Every possible way
                   into this wing.

        Hudson gathers himself, thankful for the direction.
        Hicks nods approval of her handling of it.

                                  HUDSON
                   Aye-firmative.  I'm on it.

                                  BISHOP
                   I'll be in medical.  I'd like to
                   continue my analysis.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Fine.  You do that.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         117

        Burke, Ripley, Hudson and Hicks are bent over a large
        HORIZONTAL VIDEOSCREEN, like an illuminated chart table.
        Newt hops from one foot to the other to see.

                                  RIPLEY
                   This service tunnel is how they're
                   moving back and forth.

                                  HUDSON
                   Yeah, right, it runs from the
                   processing station right into
                   the sublevel here.

        He traces a finger along the abstract ground plan.

                                  RIPLEY
                   All right.  There's a fire door
                   at this end.  The first thing we
                   do is put a remote sentry in the
                   tunnel and seal that door.

                                  HICKS
                   We gotta figure on them getting
                   into the complex.

                                  RIPLEY
                   That's right.  So we put up
                   welded barricades at these
                   intersections...
                          (pointing)
                   ...and seal these ducts here
                   and here.  Then they can only
                   come at us from these two
                   corridors and we create a free
                   field of fire for the other
                   two sentry units, here.

        Hicks contemplates her game plan and raises his hand,
        satisfied.

                                  HICKS
                   Outstanding.  Then all we need's
                   a deck of cards.  All right, let's
                   move like we got a purpose.

                                  HUDSON
                   Aye-firmative.

                                  NEWT
                          (imitating Hudson)
                   Aye-firmative!

        INT. SERVICE TUNNEL - SUBLEVEL                          118

        A long straight service tunnel, lined with conduit,
        seems to go on forever.  Vasquez and Hudson have
        finished setting up two of the robot sentry guns on
        tripods in the tunnel.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (shouting)
                   Testing!

        She hurls a wastebasket down the tunnel, into the
        automatic field of fire.  The sentry guns swivel
        smoothly, the wastebasket bounces once...and is riddled
        by two quick bursts of EXPLODING 10MM ROUNDS into
        dime-sized shrapnel.  They retreat behind a heavy steel
        FIRE DOOR which they roll closed on its track.  Vasquez,
        using a PORTABLE WELDING TORCH, begins sealing the door
        to its frame, as Hudson paces nervously.

                                  HUDSON
                   Hudson here.  A and B
                   sentries are in place and
                   keyed.  We're sealing the
                   tunnel.

        INT. SECOND LEVEL CORRIDOR                              119

        Hicks pauses in his work.

                                  HICKS
                          (into mike)
                   Roger.

        He and Ripley are covering an air duct opening with
        a metal plate, welding it in place, showering sparks
        in the dark corridor.  Behind them Burke and Newt
        are moving back and forth with cartons of food on a
        hand truck, stacking it inside the operations center.
        Hicks sets down his welder and pulls a small object
        out of a belt pouch.  A braceletlike EMERGENCY
        LOCATING BEEPER.

                                  HICKS
                   Here, put this on.  Then
                   I can locate you anywhere
                   in the complex on this --

        He indicates a tiny TRACKER hooked to his battle
        harness.  He shrugs, a little self-consciously.

                                  HICKS
                   Just a...precaution.  You
                   know.

        Ripley pauses for a moment, regarding him
        quizzically.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (strapping
                          it on)
                   Thanks.

                                  HUDSON
                   Uh, what's next?

        She consults a printout of the floor plan.

        EXT. CONTROL BLOCK                                      120

        The wind has died utterly and in the even more eerie
        stillness a diffuse mist has rolled into shroud
        the complex.  Visibility is low in the fog.
        Everything looks underwater.  There is no movement.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           121

        In the barricaded corridor sentry-gun "C" sits waiting,
        its "ARMED" light flashing green.  Through a hole
        torn in the ceiling at the far end of the corridor
        the fog swirls in.  Water drips.  An expectant hush.

        INT. MED LAB ANNEX - OPERATING ROOM                     122

        Ripley carries an exhausted Newt through the inner
        connecting rooms of the medical wing.  She reaches
        an OPERATING ROOM which is small but very high-tech
        ...vaultlike metal walls, strange equipment.
        Several metal cots have been set up, displacing O.R.
        equipment which is pushed into one corner.

        Newt is resting her head on Ripley's shoulder, barely
        awake...out of steam.  Ripley sets her on one of
        the cots and Newt lies down.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Now you just lie here and
                   have a nap.  You're exhausted.

                                  NEWT
                   I don't want to...I have
                   scary dreams.

        This obviously strikes a chord with Ripley, but she
        feigns cheerfulness.

                                  RIPLEY
                   I'll bet Casey doesn't have
                   bad dreams.

        Ripley lifts the doll's head from Newt's tiny fingers
        and looks inside.  It is, of course, empty.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Nothing bad in here.  Maybe
                   you could just try to be like
                   her.

        Ripley closes the doll's eyes and hands her back.
        Newt rolls her eyes as if to say "don't pull that
        five-year-old shit on me, lady.  I'm six."

                                  NEWT
                   Ripley...she doesn't have
                   bad dreams because she's just
                   a piece of plastic.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Oh.  Sorry, Newt.

                                  NEWT
                   My mommy always said there
                   were no monsters.  No real
                   ones.  But there are.

        Ripley's expression becomes sober.  She brushes damp
        hair back from the child's pale forehead.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (quietly)
                   Yes, there are, aren't there.

                                  NEWT
                   Why do they tell little kids
                   that?

        Newt's voice reveals her deep sense of betrayal.
        She's seen that the world can be just as terrifying
        as her most primal child's nightmare if not more
        so, and that's a lot worse than finding out there is
        no Santa.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Well, some kids can't handle
                   it like you can.

                                  NEWT
                   Did one of those things grow
                   inside her?

        Ripley begins pulling blankets up an tucking them in
        around her tiny body.

                                  RIPLEY
                   I don't know, Newt.  That's
                   the truth.

                                  NEWT
                   Isn't that how babies come?
                   I mean people babies...they
                   grow inside you?

                                  RIPLEY
                   No, it's different, honey.

                                  NEWT
                   Did you ever have a baby?

                                  RIPLEY
                   Yes.  A little girl.

                                  NEWT
                   Where is she?

                                  RIPLEY
                          (quietly)
                   Gone.

                                  NEWT
                   You mean dead.

        It's more statement than question.  Ripley nods slowly.

        She turns, reaching for a PORTABLE SPACE HEATER
        sitting nearby, and slides it closer to the bed.  She
        switches it on.  It HUMS and emits a cozy orange
        glow.

                                  NEWT
                   Ripley, I was just thinking...
                   Maybe I could do you a favor and
                   fill in for her.  Just for a
                   while.  You can try it and if
                   you don't like it, it's okay.
                   I'll understand.  No big deal.
                   Whattya think?

        Ripley gazes at her a long time before answering...
        a conflict between the urge to crush the child to her
        in a forever hug and the knowledge that neither of them
        may see another dawn.

                                  RIPLEY
                   I think it's not the worst idea
                   I've heard all day.  Let's talk
                   about it later.

        She switches off the light and starts to rise.  Newt
        grabs her arm.  A plaintive voice in the dark.

                                  NEWT
                   Don't go!  Please.

                                  RIPLEY
                   I'll be right in the other
                   room, Newt.  And look...I can
                   see you on that camera right
                   up there.

        Newt looks at the VIDEO SECURITY CAMERA above the door.
        Ripley unsnaps the TRACKER BRACELET given to her by
        Hicks and puts it on Newt's tiny wrist, cinching it
        down.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Here.  Take is for luck.  Now
                   go to sleep...and don't dream.

        Ripley walks away and Newt rolls on her side, hugging
        Casey and gazing at the hypnotically pulsing function
        light on the bracelet.  The space heater hums
        comfortingly.

        INT. MED LAB                                            123

        ECU Gorman, his eyelids slitted open like those of a
        corpse, but with the eyes tracking erratically.  The
        only sign of life.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (voice over)

                   How is he?

        Ripley stands over the Lieutenant, who is lying
        motionless on an examining table.  Bishop looks up
        from his instruments nearby, the light of a single
        gooseneck lamp giving his features a macabre cast.

                                  BISHOP
                   I've isolated a neuro-muscular
                   toxin responsible for the
                   paralysis.  It seems to be
                   metabolizing.  He should wake
                   up soon.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Now let me get this straight.
                   The aliens paralyzed the colonists,
                   carried them over there,

                   cocooned them to be hosts for
                   more of those...

        Ripley points at the stasis cylinders containing the
        face-hugger specimens.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Which would mean lots of
                   those parasites, right?  One
                   for each person...over a hundred
                   at least.

                                  BISHOP
                   Yes.  That follows.

                                  RIPLEY
                   But these things come from
                   eggs...so where are all the
                   eggs coming from.

                                  BISHOP
                   That is the question of the
                   hour.  We could assume a parallel
                   to certain insect forms who
                   have hivelike organization.
                   An ant of termite colony, for
                   example, is ruled by a single
                   female, a queen, which is the
                   source of new eggs.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You're saying one of those things
                   lays all the eggs?

                                  BISHOP
                   Well, the queen is always physically
                   larger then the others.  A
                   termite queen's abdomen is so
                   bloated with eggs that it can't
                   move at all.  It is fed and tended
                   by drone workers, defended by
                   the warriors.  She is the center
                   of their lives, quite literally
                   the  mother of their society.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Could it be intelligent?

                                  BISHOP
                   Hard to say.  It may have been
                   blind instinct...attraction to
                   the heat of whatever...but she
                   did choose to incubate her eggs
                   in the one spot where we couldn't
                   destroy her without destroying
                   ourselves.  That's if she exists,
                   of course.

        Ripley ponders the ramifications of Bishop's analysis.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (rising)
                   I want those specimens destroyed
                   as soon as you're done with them.
                   You understand?

        Bishop glances at the creatures, pulsing malevolently
        in their cylinders.

                                  BISHOP
                   Mr. Burke have instructions
                   that they were to be kept alive
                   in stasis for return to the
                   company labs.  He was very specific.

        Ripley feels the fabric of her self-restraint tearing.
        She slaps the intercom switch.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Burke!

        INT. MED LAB ANNEX                                      124

        In a small observation chamber separated from the med
        lab by a glass partition, Ripley and Burke have
        squared off.

                                  BURKE
                   Those specimens are worth
                   millions to the bio-weapons
                   division.  Now, if you're smart
                   we can both come out of this
                   heroes.  Set up for life.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You just try getting a dangerous
                   organism past ICC quarantine.
                   Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.

                                  BURKE
                   You've been doing your homework.
                   Look, they can't impound it if
                   they don't know about it.

                                  RIPLEY
                   But they will know about it, Burke.
                   From me.  Just like they'll know
                   how you were responsible for the
                   deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven
                   colonists here --

                                  BURKE
                   Now, wait a second --

                                  RIPLEY
                          (stepping on him)
                   You sent them to that ship.  I
                   just checked the colony log...
                   directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine.
                   Signed Burke, Carter J.

        Ripley's fury is peaking, now that the frustration and
        rage finally have a target to focus on.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You sent them out there and you
                   didn't even warn them, Burke.
                   Why didn't you warn them?

                                  BURKE
                   Look, maybe the thing didn't even
                   exist, right?  And if I'd made it
                   a major security situation, the
                   Administration would've stepped
                   in.  Then no exclusive rights,
                   nothing.

        He shrugs, his manner blase, dismissive.

                                  BURKE
                   It was a bad call, that's all.

        Ripley snaps.  She slams him against the wall, surprising
        herself and him, her hands gripping his collar.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Bad call?  These people are fucking
                   dead, Burke!  Well, they're going
                   to nail your hide to the shed...
                   and I'll be there when they do.

        She steps back, shaking, and looks at him with utter
        loathing, as if the depths of human greed are a far
        more horrific revelation than any alien.

                                  BURKE
                          (sadly)
                   I expected more of you, Ripley.
                   I thought you would be smarter
                   than this.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Sorry to disappoint you.

        She turns away and strides out.  The door closes.
        Burke stares after her, his mind a whirl of options.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           125

        Ripley is walking toward operations when a STRIDENT
        ALARM begins to sound.  She breaks into a run.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         126

        Ripley double-times it to Hicks' TACTICAL CONSOLE
        where Hudson and Vasquez have already gathered.  Hicks
        slaps a switch, killing the alarm.

                                  HICKS
                   They're coming.  They're in
                   the tunnel.

        The TRILLING of the motion sensor remains, speeding up.
        TWO RED LIGHTS on the tactical display light up
        simultaneously with an echoing crash of gunfire which
        vibrates the floor.

                                  HICKS
                   Guns A and B.  Tracking and firing
                   on multiple targets.

        The RSS guns pound away, echoing through the complex.
        Their separate bursts overlap in an irregular rhythm.
        A counter on the display counts down the number of
        rounds fired.

                                  HUDSON
                   They must be wall to wall in
                   there.  Look  at those ammo counters
                   go.  It's a shooting gallery down
                   there.

        INT. SERVICE TUNNEL - TIGHT ON RSS GUNS                 127

        blasting stroboscopically in the tunnels.  Their barrels
        are overheating, glowing cherry red.  One CLICKS empty
        and sits smoking, still swiveling to track targets it
        can't fire upon.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         128

        The digital counter on B gun reads zero.

                                  HICKS
                   B gun's dry.  Twenty on A.
                   Ten.  Five.  That's it.

        SILENCE.  Then a GONGLIKE BOOMING echoes eerily up from
        sublevel.

                                  RIPLEY
                   They're at the fire door.

        The BOOMING INCREASES in volume and ferocity.

                                  HUDSON
                   Man, listen to that.

        Mixed with the echoing crash-clang is a nerve-wrecking
        SCREECH of claws on steel.  The intercom buzzes,
        startling them.

                                  BISHOP
                          (voice over)
                   Bishop here.  I'm afraid I have
                   some bad news.

                                  HUDSON
                   Well, that's a switch.

        INT. OPERATIONS - MINUTES LATER                         129

        Everyone, including Bishop, is crowded at the window,
        intently watching the AP station which is a dim
        silhouette in the mist.  Suddenly a column of flame,
        like an acetylene torch, jets upward from the complex
        at the base of the cone.

                                  BISHOP
                   That's it.  See it?  Emergency
                   venting.

                                  RIPLEY
                   How long until it blows?

                                  BISHOP
                   I'm projecting total systems
                   failure in a little under four
                   hours.  The blast radius will be
                   about thirty kilometers.  About
                   equal to ten megatons.

                                  HICKS
                   We got problems.

                                  HUDSON
                   I don't fucking believe this.
                   Do you believe this?

                                  RIPLEY
                   And it's too late to shut it down?

                                  BISHOP
                   I'm afraid so.  The crash did too
                   much damage.  The overload is
                   inevitable, at this point.

                                  HUDSON
                   Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short,
                   too!  Four more weeks and out.
                   Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin'
                   rock.  It ain't half fair, man!

                                  VASQUEZ
                   Hudson, give us a break.

        They watch as another gas jet lights up the fog-shrouded
        landscape.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to Hicks)
                   We need the other drop-ship.  The
                   on one the Sulaco.  We have to
                   bring it down on remote, somehow.

                                  HUDSON
                   How?  The transmitter was on the
                   APC.  It's wasted.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (pacing)
                   I don't care how!  Think of a
                   way.  Think of something.

                                  HUDSON
                   Think of what?  We're fucked.

                                  RIPLEY
                   What about the colony transmitter?
                   That up-link tower down at the
                   other end.  Why can't we use that?

                                  BISHOP
                   I checked.  The hard wiring
                   between here and there was severed
                   in the fighting.

        Ripley is wound up like a dynamo, her mind spinning out
        options, grim solutions.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Well then somebody's just going
                   to have to go out there.  Take a
                   portable terminal and go out there
                   and plug in manually.

                                  HUDSON
                   Oh, right!  Right!  With those
                   things running around.  No way.

                                  BISHOP
                          (quietly)
                   I'll go.

                                  RIPLEY
                   What?

                                  BISHOP
                   I'm really the only one qualified
                   to remote-pilot the ship anyway.
                   Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I
                   may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.

                                  RIPLEY
                   All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll
                   you need?

                                  VASQUEZ
                   Listen.  It's stopped.

        They listen.  Nothing.  An instant later comes the
        HIGH-PITCHED TRILLING of a motion-sensor alarm.  Hicks
        looks at the tactical board.

                                  HICKS
                   Well, they're into the complex.

        INT. MED LAB                                            130

        One of the acid holes from the colonists' siege has
        yielded access to subfloor conduits.  Bishop lying in
        the opening, reaches up to graph the portable terminal
        as Ripley hands it down to him.  He pushes it into
        the constricted shaft ahead of him.  She then hands him
        a small satchel containing tools and assorted patch
        cables, a service pistol and a small cutting torch.

                                  BISHOP
                   This duct runs almost to the
                   up-link assembly.  One hundred
                   eighty meters.  Say, forty minutes
                   to crawl down there.  One hour
                   to patch in and align the antenna.
                   Thirty minutes to prep the ship,
                   then about fifty minutes flight time.

        Ripley looks at her watch.

                                  RIPLEY
                   It's going to be closer.  You
                   better get going.

                                  BISHOP
                          (cheerfully)
                   See you soon.

        She squirms into the shaft, pushing the equipment along
        ahead of him with a scraping rhythm.  The diameter of
        the conduit is barely larger than the width of his
        shoulders.  Vasquez slides a metal plate over the hole
        and begins spot welding it in place.

        INT. CONDUIT                                            131

        Bishop looks back as the welder seals him in.  He sighs
        fatalistically and squirms forward.  Ahead of him the
        conduit dwindles straight to seeming infinity.  Like
        being in the bore of a very long Howitzer.

        INT. MED LAB                                            132

        Ripley jumps as an ALARM suddenly blares through the
        complex.

                                  HICKS
                          (voice over)
                   They're in the approach corridor.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (into mike)
                   On my way.

        Ripley jumps up, unslinging a FLAMETHROWER from her
        shoulder in one motion, and sprints for Operations with
        Vasquez.  The sound of SENTRY GUNS opening up in
        staccato bursts echoes from close by.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         133

        Ripley runs to the tactical console where Hicks is
        mesmerized by the images from the surveillance cameras.
        The flashes of the sentry guns flare out the sensitive
        video, but impressions of figures moving in the smoky
        corridor are occasionally visible.  The robot sentries
        hammer away, driving streamers of tracer fire into
        the swirling mist.

                                  HICKS
                   Twenty meters and closing.
                   Fifteen.  C and D guns down
                   about fifty percent.

        The digital readout whirl through descending numbers.
        An inhuman SHRILL SCREECHING is audible between bursts
        of fire.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Now many?

                                  HICKS
                   Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's
                   down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.

        Then the firing from the remaining guns stop abruptly.
        The video image is a swirling wall of smoke.  Small fires
        burn, dim glows in the mist.  There are black and
        twisted shapes, and pieces of twisted shapes, scattered
        at the edge of visibility.  However, nothing emerges
        from the wall of smoke.  The motion sensor TONE shuts off.

                                  RIPLEY
                   They retreated.  The guns stopped
                   them.

        The moment stretches.  Everyone exhales slowly.

                                  HICKS
                   Yeah.  But look...

        The digital counters for the two sentry guns read "0"
        and "10" respectively.  Less than a second's worth of
        firing.

                                  HICKS
                   Newt time then can walk right
                   up and knock.

                                  RIPLEY
                   But they don't know that.  They're
                   probably looking for other ways
                   to get in.  That'll take them awhile.

                                  HUDSON
                   Maybe we got 'em demoralized.

                                  HICKS
                          (to Vasquez
                          and Hudson)
                   I want you two walking the perimeter.
                   I know we're all in strung out
                   shape but stay frosty and alert.
                   We've got to stop any entries before
                   they get out of hand.

        The two troopers nod and head for the corridor.  Ripley
        sighs and picks up a cup of cold coffee, draining it in
        one gulp.

                                  HICKS
                   How long since you slept?
                   Twenty-four hours?

        Ripley shrugs.  She seems soul weary, drained by the
        nerve-wracking tension.  When she answers, her voice
        seems distant, detached.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (grimly)
                   They'll get us.

                                  HICKS
                   Maybe.  Maybe not.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like
                   those others.  You'll take care of
                   it won't you, it if comes to that?

                                  HICKS
                   If it comes to that, I'll do us
                   both.  Let's see that it doesn't
                   Here, I'd like to introduce you to
                   a close personal friend of mine.

        He picks up his pulse-rifle and with the casually precise
        movements of long practice he snaps open the bolt, drops
        out the magazine and hands it to her.

                                  HICKS
                   M-41A 10mm pulse-rifle, over and
                   under with a 30mm pump-action
                   grenade launcher.

        Ripley hefts the weapon.  It is heavy and awkward.  But
        there is an irrational promise of security in its lethal
        cold steel lines, to at least the sense that she will
        be in some greater measure the master of her own fate.
        She raises it clumsily.

                                  RIPLEY
                   What do I do?

        INT. CONDUIT                                            134

        Bishop is in claustrophobic limbo between two echoing
        infinities.  The pipe rings with his scraping advance.
        He approaches an irregular hole which admits a tiny
        shaft of light.  He puts his eyes up to the acid-etched
        opening.

        HIS P.O.V.  as drooling jaws flash toward us, SLAMMING
        against the steel with a vicious scraping SNAP.

        Bishop flattens himself away from the opening and
        inches along, looking pale and strained.  He glances at
        his watch.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         135

        Ripley has the stock of the M-41A snugged up to her cheek
        and is awkwardly trying to keep up with Hicks'
        instructions.  The Corporal is standing close behind her,
        positioning her arms.  It's intimate but that's the
        last thing on their minds.

                                  HICKS
                   Just pull it in real right.  It
                   will kick some.  When the counter
                   here heads zero, hit this...

        He thumbs a button and the magazine drops out, clattering
        on the floor.

                                  HICKS
                   Just let it drop right out.  Get
                   the other one in quick.  Just
                   slap it in hard, it likes abuse.
                   Now, pull the bolt.

        CLACK.

                                  HICKS
                   You're ready again.

        Ripley repeats the action, not very smoothly.  Her hands
        are trembling.  She indicates a stout TUBE underneath
        the slender pulse-rifle barrel.

                                  RIPLEY
                   What's this?

                                  HICKS
                   Well, that's the grenade launcher
                   ...you probably don't want to
                   mess with that.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Look, you started this.  Now show
                   me everything.  I can handle myself.

                                  HICKS
                   Yeah.  I've noticed.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           136

        DOLLYING WITH Ripley walking down the corridor, now
        carrying the newfound friend, the M-41A.  Gorman steps
        out of the door to the med lab, looking weak but sound.
        Burke is right behind him.

                                  RIPLEY
                   How do you feel?

                                  GORMAN
                   All right, I guess.  One hell
                   of a hangover.  Look, Ripley...
                   I...

                                  RIPLEY
                   Forget it.

        She shoulders by him into the med lab.  Gorman turns to
        see Vasquez staring at him with cold, slitted eyes.

                                  GORMAN
                   You still want to kill me?

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (turning away)
                   It won't be necessary.

        INT. MED LAB - ANNEX                                    137

        Ripley crosses the deserted lab, passing through the
        annex to the small O.R. where she left Newt.

        INT. MED LAB - O.R.                                     138

        Entering the darkened chamber, Ripley looks around.
        Newt is nowhere to be seen.  On a hunch she kneels down
        and peers under the bed.  Newt is curled up there,
        jammed as far back as she can get, fast asleep.  Still
        clutching "Casey."

        Ripley stares at Newt's tiny face, so angelic despite
        the demons that have chased her through her dreams and
        the reality between dreams.  Ripley lays the rifle on
        top of the cot and crawls carefully underneath.  Without
        waking the little girl, she slips her arms around her.

        Ripley becomes merely the larger of two children huddling
        together in the darkness under their bed.

        Newt's face contorts with the externalization of some
        tormented dreamscape.  She cries out, a vague inarticulate
        plea.  Ripley rocks her gently.

                                  RIPLEY
                   There, there.  Sssshh.  It's all
                   right.

        EXT. Up-LINK TOWER - VIEW OF AP STATION                 139

        A VIEW OF the processing station from the colony landing
        platform.  A rising wind is clearing out the low fog and
        the silhouette of the station grows sharper.  Several
        systems of high pressure conduits at the base of the
        conical tower are actually glowing dull red with heat in
        the darkness.  High voltage discharges arc around the
        upper latticework, lighting the blighted landscape
        with irregular glaring flashes.

        PAN ONTO BISHOP, F.G.  hunched against the wind at the
        base of the telemetry tower.  He has a TEST-BAY PANEL
        open and the portable terminal patched in.  His jacket
        is draped over the keyboard and monitor unit to protect
        it from the elements and he is typing frenetically.

                                  BISHOP
                          (to himself)
                   Now, if I did it right...

        He punches a key marked "ENABLE."

        INT. SULACO CARGO LOCK - IN ORBIT                       140

        The drop bay is empty and silent, with the remaining
        ship brooding in the shadows.  A KLAXON sounds and
        rotating clearance lights come on.  Hydraulics whine
        to life.  Drop-ship two moves out on its overhead track
        and is lowered into the drop bay fro launch-prep.
        Service booms and fueling couplers move in automatically
        around the hull.  A recorded announcement echoes across
        the huge chamber.

                                  FEMALE VOICE
                   Attention.  Attention.  Automatic
                   fueling operations have begun.
                   Please extinguish all smoking
                   materials.

        INT. OPERATING ROOM - TIGHT ON RIPLEY - MED LAB         141

        as she awakens with a start.  She checks her watch...
        an hour has passed.  She gently disengages herself from
        Newt and is about to crawl out from beneath the cot
        when she sees something and FREEZES.

        Across the room, just inside the door to the med lab,
        are two innocuous but nonetheless chilling objects.
        TWO STASIS CYLINDERS.  Their tops are hinged open, and
        the suspension fields are switched off.  They are both
        EMPTY.  Ripley feels a slow upwelling wave of terror
        rise through her in that silent frozen moment...the
        inescapable certainty of a lethal presence.  Unable to
        move or breathe, she looks around frantically, assessing
        the situation.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (whispers)
                   Newt.  Newt, wake up.

                                  NEWT
                   Wah...?  Where are...?

                                  RIPLEY
                          (whispers)
                   Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in
                   trouble.

        Newt nods, now wide awake.  They listen in the darkness
        for the slightest betrayal of movement.  The scrabble
        of multiple legs across the polished floor, for example.

        There is only the droning HUM of the little space heater.
        Ripley reaches up and, clutching the springs of the
        underside of the cot, begins to inch it away from the
        wall.

        The SQUEAL OF METAL as the legs scrape across the floor
        is jarringly loud in the stillness.

        When the space is wide enough she cautiously slides
        herself up between the wall and the edge of the cot,
        reaching for the rifle she left lying on top of the
        mattress.  Here yes clear the edge of the bed.  The rifle
        is GONE.

        She snaps her head around.  A SCUTTLING SHAPE LEAPS
        TOWARD HER from the foot of the bed!  She ducks with
        a startled cry.  The obscene thing hits the wall above
        her, legs moving lightning fast.  Reflexively she slams
        the bed against the wall, pinning the creature inches
        above her face.  Its legs and tail writhe with
        incredible ferocity and it emits a demented, piercing
        SQUEAL.

        Ripley heaves Newt across the polished floor and in a
        frenzied scramble rolls from beneath the cot.  She
        flips it over, trapping the creature underneath.

        They back away, gasping.  Ripley's eyes flash around
        the shadowed room where every corner of space
        between equipment holds lethal promise.  The creature
        scuttles from beneath the bed and disappears under a
        back of cabinets in a blur.  Ripley hugs Newt close
        and heads toward the door, moving as if every object in
        the room had a million volts running through it.  She
        reaches the door.  Hits the wall switch.  Nothing
        happens.  Disabled from outside.  She tries the lights.
        Nothing.  She pounds on the door.  The acoustically
        dampened door panel thunks dully.  She moves to the
        observation window, glancing frantically over her
        shoulder.  The bare floor behind her is like a screaming
        threat.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (shouting)
                   Hey...hey!

        She pounds on the window.  Through the double
        thickness window we can SEE that the lab is dark and
        empty.  Ripley whirls, hearing a loathsome scrabbling
        behind her.  Newt starts to whimper, feeding off her
        fear.  She steps in front of the video surveillance
        camera and waves her arms in a circle.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Hicks!  Hicks!

        INT. OPERATIONS - TIGHT ON VIDEO MONITOR                142

        showing Ripley waving her arms.  There is no sound,
        a surreal pantomime.

        A hand ENTERS FRAME and switches off the monitor.
        Ripley's image vanishes.

        WIDER ANGLE  as Burke straightens casually from
        the console.  Hicks is talking via headset with
        Bishop and hasn't noticed Ripley's plight or
        Burke's action.

                                  HICKS
                          (into mike)
                   Roger.  Check back when you've
                   activated the ship.
                          (turning)
                   He's at the up-link tower.

                                  BURKE
                          (calmly)
                   Excellent.

        INT. OPERATING ROOM                                     143

        Ripley picks up a steel chair and slams it against
        the observation window.  It bounces back from the
        high-impact material.  She tries again.

        REVERSE ANGLE  from the med lab side, showing her
        futile efforts, the chair hitting with a dull THWACK
        barely audible through the double thickness pressure
        port.

        Ripley turns, studying the room.  She fumbles through
        a clutter of equipment on a counter next to her and
        finds a SMALL EXAMINATION LIGHT.  Snapping it on she
        plays the beam over the walls.  Tall assemblies of
        surgical and anaethesiology equipment loom in the
        dark.  She hears, ot thinks she hears, movements.  The
        light spins across the room, swiveling and bobbing
        frantically.  Like an indicator of her growing panic.
        Newt starts a thin, high wailing.

                                  NEWT
                   Mommy...mommmyyyyy...

        Ripley steadies herself, realizing Newt's terror and
        the child's dependence on her.  She plays the beam
        across the ceiling.  Holds on something.  Gets an idea.
        She removes her lighter from a jacket pocket and picks
        up some papers from the counter.  Moving cautiously
        she boosts Newt up onto the SURGICAL TABLE in the center
        of the room and clambers up after her.

                                  NEWT
                   Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm
                   scared.

                                  RIPLEY
                   I know, honey.  Me too.

        Ripley lights the papers and holds the flaming mass
        under the temperature sensor of a fire control system
        SPRINKLER HEAD.  It triggers, spraying the room from
        several sources with water.  An ALARM sounds throughout
        the complex.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         144

        Hicks jumps at the sound of the alarm, finally
        identifying its source among the lights flashing on
        his board.  He bolts for the door, yelling into his
        headset as he moves.

                                  HICKS
                   Vasquez, Hudson, meet me in
                   medical!  We got a fire!

        INT. OPERATING ROOM                                     145

        Ripley and Newt are drenched as the sprinklers
        continue to drizzle in the darkness.  The SIREN
        hoots maniacally, masking all other sound.  Ripley
        scans the room with her light, her hair plastered
        to her face, wiping water out of her eyes.  She is
        eye level with a complex surgical MULTILIGHT.  She
        looks into its tangle of arms and cables, inches away.
        Looks away.  Her eyes snap back.  SOMETHING LEAPS AT
        HER FACE.  She SCREAMS and topples off the table,
        splashing to the floor.  Newt shrieks and scrambles
        away as Ripley hurls the CHITTERING creature off of
        her.  It slams against a wall of cabinets, clings
        for a moment, then leaps back as if driven by a
        steel spring.  Ripley scrambles desperately, pulling
        equipment over on top of herself, clawing across the
        floor in a frenzy of motion.  In a blurr of
        multijointed legs the creature scuttles up her body.

        She tears at it, but it is incredibly powerful for
        its size.  It moves like lightning toward her head,
        avoiding her fumbling hands.  Newt screams abjectly,
        backing away, until she is pressed up against a
        desk in one corner.

        Ripley has both hands up, forcing the pulsing body
        back from her face.  The thing's tail whips around
        her throat and begins to tighten, forcing the underside
        of its body close to her.  Ripley thrashes about,
        knocking over equipment, sending instruments CLATTERING.
        Water streams over her, into her eyes, blinding her
        and making it impossible to get a grip on the creature's
        body.

        ANGLE ON NEWT  as crablike legs appear from behind the
        desk, right behind her.  She sees it and, thinking
        fast, jams the desk against the wall, pinning the
        writhing thing.  The desk jumps and shudders against
        all the pressure her tiny body can bring to bear on it.
        She wails between gritted teeth as the second creature
        gets one leg free, then another and another.  Squeezing
        itself inexorably onto the desk top...toward her.

        The legs of the chittering thing claw at Ripley's
        head, getting a surer grip even as she whips her head
        from side to side.  The obscene TUBULE extrudes wetly
        from the sheath on the creature's underside, forcing
        itself between the arms she has crossed tightly over
        her face.

        A figure appears at the observation window, a silhouette
        behind the misted-over glass.  A hand wipes a clear spot.
        Hick's eyes appear.  He steps back.  WHAM!  A burst of
        pulse-rifle fire shatters the tempered glass.  Hicks
        dives into the crazed spider web pattern and explodes
        into the room in a shower of fragments.  He hits
        rolling, his armor grinding through the shards, and
        slides across to Ripley.  He gets his fingers around the
        thrashing legs of the vicious beast and pulls.  Between
        the two of them they force is away from her face,
        though Ripley is losing strength as the tail tightens
        sickeningly around her throat.  Hudson leaps into the
        room, flings Newt away from the desk to go skidding
        across the wet floor, and blasts the second creature
        against the wall.  Point-blank.  Acid and smoke.

        Gorman appears at Ripley's side and grabs the tail,
        unwinding its writhing length like a boa constrictor
        coil from her throat.  All of them grip the struggling,
        SHRIEKING creature.

                                  HICKS
                   The corner!  Ready?

                                  HUDSON
                   Do it!

        Hicks hurls the thing into the corner.  It scrabbles
        upright in an instant and leaps back toward them.
        WHAM!  Hudson gets it clean.

        Ripley collapses, gagging.  The alarm and sprinklers
        shut off automatically.  Hicks sees the stasis
        cylinders.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (coughing)
                   Burke...it was Burke.

        INT. OPERATIONS - ANGLE ON HUDSON                       146

        looking decidedly stressed-out.  He grips his rifle
        tightly, AIMED RIGHT AT CAMERA.

                                  HUDSON
                          (intense)
                   I say we grease this rat-fuck
                   son of a bitch right now!

        THE GROUP is gathered around Burke who sits in a
        chair, maintaining an icy calm although beads of
        sweat betray intense concealed tension.  Only a few
        minutes have passes and everyone is still buzzed on
        adrenaline, as if the whole group is charged with
        high voltage.

                                  HICKS
                          (pacing)
                   I don't get it.  It doesn't
                   make any Goddamn sense.

        Ripley stands in front of Burke, every fiber of
        her being accusing him with absolute outrage.  Burke
        tries to break Ripley's stare, which is like a
        diamond drill.  He can't.

                                  RIPLEY
                   He wanted an alien, only he
                   couldn't get it back through
                   quarantine.  But if we were impregnated
                   ...whatever you call it...and then
                   frozen for the trip back at just
                   the right time...then nobody would
                   know about the embryos we were carrying.
                   We and Newt.

        Ripley glances at the little girl, a frail figure
        sitting nearby, hugging her knees and watching the
        proceedings with somber eyes.  She is all but lost in
        an adult jacket someone has found for her, and her still
        damp hair is plastered to her forehead and cheeks.

                                  HICKS
                   Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.

                                  RIPLEY
                   The only way it would work is if
                   he sabotaged certain freezers
                   on the trip back.  Then he could
                   jettison the bodies and make up
                   any story he liked.

                                  HUDSON
                   Fuuuck!  He's dead.
                          (to Burke)
                   You're dogmeat, pal.

                                  BURKE
                   This is total paranoid delusion.
                   It's pitiful.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (wearily)
                   You know, Burke, I don't know
                   which species is worse.  You don't
                   see them screwing each other over
                   for a fucking percentage.

                                  HICKS
                          (serious)
                   Let's waste him.
                          (to Burke)
                   No offense.

        Ripley shakes her head, the rage giving way to a
        sickened emptiness.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Just find someplace to lock him
                   up until it's time to --

        THE LIGHTS GO OUT.  Everyone stops in the sudden darkness,
        realizing instinctively it is a new escalation in the
        struggle.  Hicks looks at the board.  Everything is out.
        Doors.  Video screens.

                                  RIPLEY
                   They cut the power.

                                  HUDSON
                   What do you mean, they cut the
                   power?  How could they cut the
                   power, man?  They're animals.

        Ripley picks up her rifle and thumbs off the safety.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt!  Stay close.
                          (to the others)
                   Let's get some trackers going.
                   Come on, get moving.  Gorman, watch
                   Burke.

        Hudson and Vasquez pick up their scanners and move to
        the door.  Vasquez has to slide it open manually on its
        track.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           147

        barriers at opposite ends of the control block.

                   Anything?

        BEEP.  Hudson's tracker lights up, a faint signal.

                                  HUDSON
                   There's something.

        He pans it around.  Back down the corridor.  It beep
        again, louder.

                                  HUDSON
                   It's inside the complex.

                   You're just reading me.

                   No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're
                   inside.  Inside the perimeter.
                   They're in here.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Hudson, stay cool.  Vasquez?

        ANGLE ON VASQUEZ  swinging her tracker and rifle together.
        She aims it behind her.  BEEP.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (cool)
                   Hudson may be right.

        Ripley and Hicks share a look..."here we go."

                          (low)

                                  RIPLEY
                   Get back here, both of you.  Fall

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           149

        Hudson backtracks nervously, peering all around.  He
        looks stretched to the limit.

                                  HUDSON
                   This signal's weird...must be
                   some interference or something.
                   There's movement all over the
                   place...

                                  RIPLEY
                          (voice over)
                   Just get back here!

        Hudson reaches the door to operations at a run, a
        moment before Vasquez.  They pull the door shut and
        lock it.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         150

        Hudson joins Ripley and Hicks, who are laying out their
        armament.  Flamethrowers.  Grenades.  M-41A magazines.
        Hudson's tracker beeps.  Then again.  The tone continues
        through the SCENE, its rhythm increasing.

                                  HUDSON
                   Movement!  Signal's clean.

        He pans the scanner.  Stops.  The range display reads
        out, counting down.

                                  HUDSON
                   Range twenty meters.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to Vasquez)
                   Seal the door.

        Vasquez picks up a hand-welder and moves to comply.

                                  HUDSON
                   Seventeen meters.

                                  HICKS
                   Let's get these things lit.

        He hands one flamethrower to RIpley and begins priming
        the other himself.  It lights with a muffled POP.
        Ripley's lights a moment later.  Sparks shower around
        Vasquez as she begins welding the door.  Hudson's tracker
        is beeping like mad now, as fast as their hearts.

                                  RIPLEY
                   They learned.  They cut the power
                   and avoided the guns.  They must
                   have found another way in, something
                   we missed.

                                  HICKS
                   We didn't miss anything.

                                  HUDSON
                   Fifteen meters.

                                  RIPLEY
                   I don't know, an acid hole in
                   a duct.  Something under the
                   floors, not on the plans.
                   I don't know!

        She picks up Vasquez' scanner and aims it the same
        direction as Hudson's.

                                  HUDSON
                   Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big
                   fucking signal.  Ten meters.

                                  RIPLEY
                   They're right on us.  Vasquez,
                   how you doing?

        Vasquez is heedlessly showering herself with molten metal
        as she welds the door shut.  Working like a demon.

                                  HUDSON
                   Nine meters.  Eight.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Can't be.  That's inside the room!

                                  HUDSON
                   It's readin' right.  Look!

        Ripley fiddles with her tracker, adjusting the tuning.

                                  HICKS
                   Well you're not reading it right!

                                  HUDSON
                   Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --

        He looks at Ripley.  It dawns on both of them at the same
        time.  She feels a cold premonitory dread as she angles
        her tracker upward to the ceiling, almost overhead.  The
        tone gets louder.

        Hicks climbs onto a file cabinet and raises a panel of
        acoustic drop-ceiling.  He shines his light inside.

        HICKS' P.O.V.                                           151

        A soul-wrenching nightmare image.  Moving in the beam of
        light are aliens.  Lots of aliens.  They are crawling
        like bats, upside down, clinging to the pipes and beams
        of the structural ceiling, not touching the flimsy
        acoustic panels.  They glisten hideously as they claw
        their way forward in silence.  They cover the ceiling
        of the operations room.  The inner sanctum is utterly
        violated.

        ON HICKS                                                152

        blasted by fear.

        Something moves...he snaps the light around.  It's a
        meter behind him.  IT LUNGES!  He drops reflexively,
        the claws raking across his armor.

        Hicks falls into the room just as the creatures detach
        en masse from the handholds.  THE CEILING EXPLODES,
        raining debris.  Nightmare shapes drop into the room.
        Newt screams.  Hudson opens fire.  Vasquez grabs Hicks,
        pulls him up, firing one handed with her flamethrower.
        Ripley scoops up Newt and staggers back.  Gorman turns
        to fire and Burke bolts for the only remaining exit,
        the corridor connecting to the med lab.  In the
        strobelike glare of the pulse-rifles we SEE flashes
        of aliens, moving forward in the smoke from the
        flamethrower fires.  They move like nothing human...
        leaping quick as insects at times or gliding with
        powerful, balletic grace.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Medical!  Get to medical!

        She dashes for the corridor.

        INT. MED LAB CORRIDOR                                   153

        DOLLYING BEHIND HER as she sprints, the walls becoming
        a frenzied blur.  Ahead of her Burke clears the door to
        the med lab.  HE SLIDES IT CLOSED.  Ripley slams into
        the door.  Tries the latch.  Hears it LOCK from the far
        side.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Burke!  Open the door!

                                  NEWT
                   Look!

        Behind her an alien is moving down the corridor like a
        locomotive, a graceful skeleton shape as lethal and
        inhuman as you can imagine.  Strobe flashes backlight
        the demented silhouette.  Shaking, Ripley raises her
        rifle.  She squeezes the trigger.  NOTHING HAPPENS.
        The creature HISSES, baring its teeth as it advances.
        Ripley checks the SAFETY.  The safety is off.  The
        DIGITAL COUNTER.  The magazine is full.  Newt begins to
        wail.  Ripley's hands, slick with sweat, are trembling
        so much she almost drops the rifle.  Panic screams in
        her brain.  The thing is almost on her, filling the
        corridor, when she remembers.  She snaps the bolt back,
        chambering a round.  Whips the stock to her shoulder.
        FIRES.  FLASH-CRACK!  A FLASHBULB GLIMPSE OF shrieking
        jaws as the silhouette is hurled back, screeching
        insanely.

        Ripley is slammed against the door by the recoil,
        blinded by the flash and deafened by the concussion.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         154

        Hicks looks up.  Fires POINT-BLANK at a leaping
        silhouette.  SCREEEECH!  The fire-control system has
        tripped, with sprinklers spraying the room and a
        mindless SIREN wailing.  Total pandemonium.

                                  HUDSON
                          (hysterical)
                   Let's go!  Let's go!

                                  HICKS
                   Fuckin' A!

        Hudson screams as floor panels lift under him, and clawed
        arms seize him lightning fast, dragging him down.
        Another skeletal shape leaps on him from above.  He
        disappears into the subfloor crawlway.  Hicks, Vasquez
        and Gorman make it to the med lab access corridor.

        INT. CORRIDOR

        Stunned, Ripley sees through dissipating smoke the
        creature rising to advance again.  Flinching against
        blast and glare she drills it POINT-BLANK with a
        BLINDING BURST that carries the M-41A's muzzle right
        up toward the ceiling.  Newt covers her ears against
        the CONCUSSION.

                                  HICKS
                          (o.s.)
                   Hold you fire!

        The troopers seem to materialize out of the smoke.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (indicating door)
                   Locked.

                                  HICKS
                   Stand back.

        Hicks snaps the torch off his belt and cuts into the
        lock.  Inhuman shapes enter the far end of the corridor.
        Vasquez hands her flamethrower to Gorman and unslings
        her rifle.  She starts loading 30mm grenades into the
        launcher, like oversize 12-guage shells.

                                  GORMAN
                   You can't use those in here!

                                  VASQUEZ
                   Right.  Fire in the hole!

        She pumps a round up and fires.  The grenade EXPLODES and
        the blast almost knocks them down.  Hicks kicks the door
        open, molten droplets flying.

                                  HICKS
                          (shouting at Vasquez)
                   Thanks a lot!  Now I can't hear shit.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (shouting)
                   What?

        INT. MED LAB ANNEX                                      156

        Vasquez slides the door almost closed, then fires three
        grenades rapid-fire through the gap.  She slams the door
        home as the grenades detonate, the explosion sounding
        gonglike through the metal.

        Ripley sprints across the room, trying the far door.
        Burke has locked it as well.  Hicks switches his
        hand-torch from CUT to WELD and starts sealing the door
        they just passed through.

        INT. MED LAB                                            157

        Burke, hyperventilating with terror, backs across the
        dark chamber.  Gasping, almost paralyzed with fear, he
        crosses the chamber to the door leading to the main
        concourse.  His fingers reach for the latch.  It moves
        by itself.  The door opens slowly.

        ON BURKE  his eyes wide, transfixed by his fate.  We
        hear the BULLWHIP CRACK of a tail-stinger striking as we:

                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. MED LAB ANNEX                                      158

        The door dimples with a clanging impact, separating
        slightly from its frame.  Another crash, the squeal of
        tortured steel.  Newt grabs Ripley by the hand and
        tugs her across the room.

                                  NEWT
                   Come on!  This way.

        She leads Ripley to an air vent set low in the wall and
        expertly unlatches the grille, swinging it open.  Newt
        starts inside but Ripley pulls her back.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Stay behind me.

        Ripley trades her rifle for Gorman's flamethrower before
        he can protest and enters the air shaft, which is a
        tight fit.  Newt scrambles in behind, followed by Hicks,
        Gorman and Vasquez on rearguard.  Glancing back
        fearfully Newt pushes on Ripley's butt as they crawl
        rapidly through the shaft.

                                  NEWT
                   Come on.  Crawl faster.

                                  RIPLEY
                   DO you know how to get to the
                   landing field from here?

                                  NEWT
                   Sure.  Go left.

        Ripley turns into a larger MAIN DUCT where there is
        enough room to crab-walk in a low crouch.  She runs,
        scraping her back on the ceiling.  The troopers' armor
        clatters in the confined space.  They approach an
        intersection.  She fires the flamethrower around the
        corner, the looks.  Clear.

                                  NEWT
                   Go right.

        They sprint into the narrow connecting duct, the maze
        becoming a blur.  Ripley fires the flamethrower
        periodically, as they pass side ducts covered by
        louvered grilles or vertical shafts going to higher or
        lower levels.

                                  HICKS
                          (into headset)
                   Bishop, you read me?  Come in, over.

        There is a long pause then Bishop's VOICE, almost
        unintelligible with interference, comes over the radio.

                                  BISHOP
                          (voice over;
                          static)
                   Yes, I read you.  Not very well...

        EXT. UP-LINK RELAY - LANDING FIELD                      159

        Bishop is huddled against the base of the telemetry
        mast, out of the wind which is now gusting viciously.

                                  BISHOP
                          (yelling;
                          over enunciating)
                   The ship is on its way.  ETA
                   about sixteen minutes.  I've
                   got my hands full flying...
                   the weather's come up a bit.

        Bishop's fingers are blurring over the terminal keys and
        he squints, watching the screen as the flight telemetry
        updates rapidly.

        In the b.g. the AP station has become a raging demon,
        wreathed in boiling steam and electrical discharges.

        INT. AIR DUCT                                           160

                                  HICKS
                   All right, stand by there.  We're
                   on out way.  Over.

        The beam of Ripley's light wavers hypnotically in the
        tunnel ahead.  She blinks, seeing something...not sure.
        A GLINTING OBSCENE FORM MOVING TOWARD THEM, filling the
        tunnel at the absolute limit of the light's power.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Back.  Go back!

        They try to crawl back, jamming together.  Behind them,
        the way they have come, a GRATING is battered in with a
        FEROCIOUS CLANG and the deadly silhouette of a warrior
        flows into the duct.  They are trapped.  Vasquez uses
        her flamethrower, bathing the tunnel in fire.  Hicks
        snaps out his hand-welder and cuts into the wall of the
        duct.  Molten metal spatters him, as sparks fill the
        tunnel with lurid light.  Vasquez' flamethrower sputters.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (icy)
                   Losing fuel.

        Between eye-searing bursts of flame Ripley sees the
        glistening apparitions closing in.  Hicks' torch feathers
        out.  Empty.  Bracing his back he kicks hard at the
        cherry-hot metal.  It bends aside.

        Beyond is a narrow SERVICE WAY, lined with pipes and
        conduit.  Hicks slides through the searing hole,
        lifting Newt safely through as Ripley hands her out.
        Ripley follows and turns to help Gorman.  Vasquez'
        flamethrower goes dry.  She draws her SERVICE PISTOL.
        Suddenly she looks up as a WARRIOR SCREECHES DOWN FROM
        A VERTICAL SHAFT, right above her.

        She fires with incredible rapidity...BAM!  BAM!  BAM!
        Rolls aside.  It lands on her legs and she snaps her head
        to one side just as its TAIL STINGER buries into the
        metal wall beside her cheek.  She fires again, emptying
        the pistol, kicking the thrashing shape away.

        Acid cuts through her chickenplate armor, searing into
        her thigh.  She cries out, gritting her teeth against
        the white-hot pain.  Gorman sees Vasquez hit, unable to
        move.  Sees the creatures coming the other way...and
        turns away from the escape hole.  He crawls back to her,
        grabs her battle harness and starts dragging her towards
        safety.  Too late.  The approaching alien warriors have
        reached and passed the opening.  Vasquez sees him,
        barely conscious.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (hoarse whisper)
                   You always were an asshole, Gorman.

        She seizes his hand in a deadly drip, but we RECOGNIZE
        it as the "power greeting" she shared with Drake...
        something for the chosen few.  Gorman returns the grip.
        He hands her two grenades and arms two himself as the
        creatures are upon them.

        INT. SERVICE WAY                                        161

        RUSHING WITH Ripley, Newt and Hicks as a full tilt run.
        The service way lights up with a POWERFUL BLAST behind
        them and they stumble with the shock wave.  Newt breaks
        out ahead and it's all Ripley and Hicks can do to keep
        up.

                                  NEWT
                   This way.  Come on, we're almost
                   there!

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt, wait!

        The kid moves like lightning, diving and dodging around
        obstacles.  If it wasn't clear before it's clear now
        that we are on her turf, and she's the ace.  Running on
        and on, their breathing loud and echoing...the walls
        a directionless blur.  Newt never hesitates.

        They reach a junction with a narrow ANGLED CHUTE which
        runs upward at a steep 45 degrees.

                                  NEWT
                   Here!  Go up.

        INT. CHUTE                                              162

        Ripley looks up the angles shaft, seeing light at the
        top...an exterior vent hood.  The sound of wind booms
        down from above.  Like blowing across a bottle top
        vastly amplified.

        Ripley enters, bracing her feet on perilously narrow
        side ribs in the shaft.  She looks down.  The chute
        descends far into the depths, lost in shadow.  She
        starts to climb with Next behind/below her, and Hicks,
        just emerging from the side duct.

                                  NEWT
                   Just up there --

        Newt slips, a rusted rib collapsing under her foot.  She
        slides...catches herself with one hand.  Ripley reaches
        for her, dropping her light.  The hand-light goes
        skittering and bumping down the chute, around a bend,
        and disappears.

        Ripley strains, reaching, her hand groping for Newt's.
        They miss, inches apart.

                                  NEWT
                   Riiiiipppleee --

        She slips.  Hicks lunges, grabbing her oversized jacket.
        AND SHE SLIPS OUT OF IT.  With an echoing scream Newt
        plummets, sliding down the chute into darkness.

        MOVING WITH HER, the walls racing by in a dizzy blur like
        a bobsled ride.  THe shaft pitches left.  Newt bounces,
        sliding halfway up the wall.  The chute forks ahead.
        Newt tumbles into the right shaft, which drops at a
        steeper angle into the depths.  Just disappearing down
        the LEFT SHAFT we SEE Ripley's light.

        Ripley looks Hicks in the eye.  And kicks free...sliding
        down the chute after Newt.  Ripley slams her feet into
        the side-ribs, bracing herself in a controlled descent.
        Ripley reaches the "V."  Sees the glow of the light in
        the left fork.  She goes left.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt!

        She hears a plaintive reply, so echoey and distorted it
        has no direction.

                                  NEWT
                          (o.s.)
                   Mommy...where are you?

        Ripley reaches the bottom of the chute where it
        intersects with a HORIZONTAL SERVICE TUNNEL.  The light
        is lying there, but no Newt.  The echoing wail comes
        again.

                                  NEWT
                          (o.s.)
                   Moooommeeee...

        Ripley starts down the tunnel, answering.  Newt's call
        comes again.  Fainter?  She can't tell.  She spins in
        a growing panic, starts the other way.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to her headset)
                   Hicks, get down here.  I need
                   that locator.

        INT. SUBBASEMENT                                        163

        Newt is in a low grottolike chamber, filled with pipes
        and machines.  It is flooded, almost up to Newt's waist.
        She looks up, seeing light streaming through a grating.
        Ripley's voice seems to come from there.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (o.s.)
                   Newt!  Star wherever you are!

        Newt climbs some pipes, straining to reach the grating.

        INT. SERVICE TUNNEL                                     164

        Hicks joins Ripley, unsnapping the emergency-locator
        from his belt.  They follow the signal into a lighted
        area where the power apparently was not cut.

                                  HICKS
                   This way.  We're close...

        Following the signal they come to a grating set in the
        floor.

                                  NEWT
                   Here!  I'm here.  I'm here.

        Ripley runs to the grating.  Looking down she sees Newt's
        tearstreaked face.  Newt reaches up.  Her tiny fingers
        wriggle up through the bars of the grate.  Ripley
        squeezes the child's precious fingertips.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Climb down, honey.  We have to
                   cut through this grate.

        Newt backs away, climbing down the pipe as Hicks cuts
        into the bars with his hand-torch.

        INT. SUBBASEMENT                                        165

        Newt, standing waist deep in the water, watches sparks
        shower blindingly as Hicks cuts.  She bites her lip,
        trembling.  Cold and terrified.  Silently a glistening
        shape rises in one graceful motion from the water behind
        her.  It stands, dripping, dwarfing her tiny form.  Newt
        turns, sensing the movement...She SCREAMS as the
        shadow engulfs her.

        INT. SERVICE TUNNEL                                     166

        Ripley panics, hearing screaming below, then splashing.
        She and Hicks kick desperately at the grating, smashing
        it down.  Heedless of the cherry-hot edges Ripley
        lunges into the hole with her light.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt!  Newt!

        The surface of the water reflects the beam placidly.
        Newt is gone.  Bobbing in the water, eyes staring, is
        "Casey" the doll head.  In sinks slowly, distorting,
        vanishing in darkness.

        Hicks pulls Ripley away from the hole.  She struggles
        furiously, trying to tear out of his grip.

                                  RIPLEY
                   No!  Noooo!

        He drags her back.  It takes all of his strength.

                                  HICKS
                          (intense)
                   She's gone!  Let's go!

        He sees something moving toward them through a lattice
        of pipes.  Ripley is irrational.  Hysterical.

                                  RIPLEY
                   No!  No!  She's alive!  We
                   have to --

                                  HICKS
                   All right!  She's alive.  I
                   believe it.  But we gotta get
                   moving!  Now!

        He drags her toward an ELEVATOR not far away at the
        end of the tunnel.  Gets her inside, slamming her against
        the back wall.  Hits the button to go to surface level.
        An alien warrior leaps into the tunnel, starts
        toward them.  The doors are closing.  Not fast enough.
        The creature gets one arm through, the doors closing on
        it.  THEY OPEN AGAIN, an automatic safety feature.  THE
        WARRIOR HISSES, LUNGING.  Hicks FIRES, POINT-BLANK.  It
        spins away, SCREECHING.  Acid sluices between the closing
        doors, across Hicks' armored chest plate, as he shields
        Ripley with his body.  The lift starts upward.  Hicks'
        fingers race with the clasps as the stuff eats its way
        toward his skin.  Galvanized out of her hysteria, Ripley
        claws at his armor, helping him as much as she can.  He
        screams as the acid contacts his chest and arm.  He
        shucks out of the combat armor like a madman, dropping
        the smoking pieces to the floor.  Acrid fumes fill the
        air, searing eyes and lungs.  The elevator stops.  The
        doors part and they stumble out, Ripley supporting Hicks
        who is doubled over in agony.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Come on, you can make it.
                   Almost there.

        EXT. LANDING FIELD                                      167

        Drop-ship two descends toward the landing grid,
        side-slipping in hurricane gusts.  Bishop stands, guiding
        it with the portable terminal.  The ship sets down hard.
        Slides sideways.  Stops.  Bishop turns as Ripley and
        Hicks stumble out of a doorway in the colony building
        behind him.  He goes to them, helping to support Hicks
        and they run toward the ship, buffeted by the gale.
        Ripley shouts, her words barely audible over the wind.

                                  RIPLEY
                   HOW MUCH TIME?

                                   BISHOP
                   PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!

                                   RIPLEY
                   WE'RE NOT LEAVING!

        The loading ramp deploys and they run into the ship.

        EXT. PROCESSING STATION                                 168

        An infernal engine, roaring out of control.  Steam blasts
        and swirls, lightning zaps around the superstructure and
        columns of incandescent gas thunder hundreds of feet into
        the air.

        We APPROACH, hypnotically.  The drop-ship ENTERS FRAME,
        moving toward the station.  It pivots, hovering in the
        blasting turbulence, and settles onto a NARROW LANDING
        PLATFORM ten levels above the ground, or about a third
        of the way up the enormous structure.

        INT. DROP-SHIP                                          169

        Ripley finishes winding tape around a bulky object and
        drops the roll.  She has crudely fastened a M-41A
        assault rifle together, side by side, with a flamethrower.
        A massive, unwieldy package of absolute firepower.  Her
        movements are curt, precise...determined.  She works
        rapidly, snatching magazines, grenades, belts and other
        gear from the fully stocked ordnance racks of the
        drop-ship.

        Bishop comes aft from the pilot's compartment to help
        Hicks dress his injuries.  Hicks is sprawled in a flight
        seat, the contents of a FIELD MEDICAL KEY strewn around
        him.  He's out of the game...contorted with pain.

                                  BISHOP
                   Ripley...

                                  RIPLEY
                   She's alive.  They brought her
                   here and you know it.

                                  BISHOP
                   In seventeen minutes this place
                   will be a cloud of vapor the
                   size of Nebraska.

        Ripley is stuffing gear rapidly into a satchel, her hands
        flying.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Hicks, don't let him leave.

                                  HICKS
                          (grimacing with
                          pain)
                   We ain't going anywhere.

        She hefts the hybrid weapon, grabs the satchel and spins
        to the door controls.  The door opens.  Wind and
        machine-thunder blast in.

                                  RIPLEY
                   See you, Hicks.

        Hicks is holding a wad of gauze plastered over his face.

                                  HICKS
                   Dwayne.  It's Dwayne.

        Ripley grabs his hand.  They share a moment, albeit
        brief.  Mutual respect in the valley of death.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Ellen.

                                  HICKS
                          (nods with
                          satisfaction)
                   Don't be long, Ellen.

        Ripley runs down the ramp, crossing the platform to the
        open doors of a LARGE FREIGHT ELEVATOR.  The doors close.

        INT. FREIGHT ELEVATOR                                   170

        The elevator descends.  Bars of light move rhythmically
        across her as Ripley stands facing the doors, watching
        the landings go by.  The heat grows more intense.  Pipes
        glowing cherry-red pass by.  Steam hisses and billows.
        The lift clatters in a steady beat.  Hypnotic.

        Ripley removes her jacket and dons a battle harness
        directly over her T-shirt.  Her hair is matted, and
        she glistens with sweat.  Her eyes burn with a
        determination that holds the gut-panic in check.

        The elevator descends.  She checks her weapon.  Attaches
        a BANDOLIER OF GRENADES to her harness.  Primes the
        flamethrower.  Checks the rifle's magazine.  Racks the
        bolt, chambering the first round.  She checks the
        MARKING FLARES jammed in the thigh pockets of her
        jump pants.  She drops an unprimed grenade, trembling,
        forcing herself to be strong.  We SEE she doesn't
        know doodley about grenades.

        This is the most terrifying thing she has ever done.  She
        begins to hyperventilate, soaking with sweat.  Her fingers
        slick and slippery on the rifle.  The elevator descends.

        The lift motors whine, slowing.  It hits bottom with a
        bump.  The safety cage retracts.  Slowly, expectantly,
        the doors open.

        HER P.O.V.  THROUGH the parting doors...an empty
        corridor.  Dark, swirling with steam, a ruddy glow
        VISIBLE here and there.  It seems to have been a descent
        into Dantean Hell.  The air itself vibrates with heat
        distortion.  Couplings groan.  Machinery whines and
        throbs.  Like the beating of a vast heart the pounding
        of massive pumps echoes through the station.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           171

        Ripley moves out of the lift, knuckles white on the
        rifle.  Her eyes dart, straining to penetrate the lethal
        gloom.  Behind her we SEE a SECOND ELEVATOR next to
        hers, its lift cage somewhere on a higher floor.  Ahead
        the corridor is encrusted with the alien excressence
        and not far down the bio-mechanoid catacomb begins.
        She enters the maze, darting glances at Hick's LOCATOR,
        taped to the top of her kludge weapon.

        A VOICE echoes down the tunnels, calm and mechanical.

                                  VOICE
                   Attention.  Emergency.  All
                   personnel must evacuate
                   immediately.  You now have
                   fourteen minutes to reach
                   minimum safe distance.

        INT. CATACOMB                                           172

        Range and direction read out in rapid-fire alpha-numerics
        on the locator display.

        Ripley blinks sweat out of her eyes, moving through the
        swirling steam of the alien maze.  She approaches an
        intersecting tunnel.  Flashing emergency lights
        illuminate the insane fresco of the walls.  She spins,
        firing the flamethrower.  Nothing there.  She whirls
        back.  Moves forward, trembling and adrenalized.

        Skeletal figures drown in the walls, frozen in macabre
        tormented positions like human insects in amber.
        Steam blasts, blinding her.  The locator signal
        strengthens an she turns, crouches through a low
        passage, turns again.  At each intersection she quickly
        lights a FIFTEEN-MINUTE MARKING FLARE and drops it.
        For the way back.  She has to turn sideways, inching
        through a fissure between two walls of death...cocoon
        niches, human bas-relief sealed in resin.


        SUDDENLY SOMETHING SHOOTS OUT, GRABBING HER!  A hand.
        She recovers , then recognizes the face sealed in
        the wall.  Carter Burke.

                                  BURKE
                   Ripley...help me.  I can feel
                   it...inside.  Oh, God...it's
                   moving!  Oh gooood...

        She looks at him.  No one deserves this.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Here.

        She hands him a grenade, wrapping his fingers around
        the spoon, and pulls the primer.  She moves on.

                                  VOICE
                   You now have eleven minutes to
                   reach minimum safe distance.

        Ripley moves ahead.  The locator signals shows she is
        almost there.  A CONCUSSION rocks the place, like an
        earthquake, jarring her almost off her feet.  Then
        another.  The whole station seems to shudder.  A SIREN
        begins to wail a demented rhythm.  Following the tracker
        she turns a corner and stops.  The RANGE INDICATOR READS
        ZERO.  She looks down, horrified to see Newt's tracer
        bracelet lying on the floor of the tunnel.  All hope
        recedes, disintegrating into mindless chaos.

        INT. EGG CHAMBER                                        173

        Newt is cocooned in a pillarlike structure at the
        edge of a cluster of upright OVOID SHAPES...alien
        eggs.  Her eyelids flutter open and she becomes
        aware of her surroundings.  The egg nearest her
        begins to move...opening like an obscene flower at
        its top to reveal something stirring within.  Newt
        stares, transfixed by terror, as the jointed legs
        appear over the lip of the ovoid one by one.  She
        SCREAMS.

        INT. CATACOMBS                                          174

        Ripley hears the scream and breaks into a run.

        INT. EGG CHAMBER                                        175

        Newt watches the face-hugger emerge and turn toward
        her.  Ripley runs in just as it is tensing to leap,
        and FIRES, blasting it with a burst from the assault
        rifle.  The flash illuminates the figure of an
        adult warrior, nearby.  It spins, moving straight
        for Ripley.  Firing from the hip she drills it with
        two controlled bursts which catapult it back.  She
        steps toward it, FIRING AGAIN.  Her expression is
        murderous.  AND AGAIN.  It spins onto its back.
        She unleashes the flamethrower and it vanishes in
        a fireball.  Ripley runs to Newt and begins tearing
        at the fresh resinous cocoon material, freeing the
        child.  She swings her up onto her back.

                                  NEWT
                          (weakly)
                   I knew you'd come.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt, I want you to hang on,
                   now.  Hang on tight.

        Groggily Newt hooks her arms and legs through the belts
        of Ripley's battle harness as Ripley picks up her
        weapon.  More warriors are moving toward her among
        the eggs.  She fires the flamethrower.  The eggs are
        engulfed.  One of the warriors lunges forward, a
        living fireball.  She blasts it in half with two
        bursts from the M-41A.  Ripley retreats, ducking under
        a glistening cylindrical mass.  A PIERCING SHRIEK
        fill the chamber.  She turns.  And there it is.

        A massive silhouette in the mist, the ALIEN QUEEN
        glowers over her eggs like a great, glistening black
        insect-Buddha.  What's bigger and meaner than the
        Alien?  His momma.  Her fanged head is an unimaginable
        horror.  Her six limbs, the four arms and two
        powerful legs, are folded grotesquely over her
        distended abdomen.  The egg-filled abdomen swells
        and swells into a great pulsing tubular sac, suspended
        from a lattice of pipes and conduits by a weblike
        membrane as if some vast coil of intestine were draped
        carelessly among the machinery.  Ripley realizes
        she ducked under part of it a moment before.  Inside
        the abdominal sac can be SEEN the forms of countless
        eggs, churning their way toward the pulsating ovipositor
        where they emerge glistening, to be picked up by
        DRONES.  The drones are tiny scuttling albino versions
        of the "warrior" aliens we have already seen.

        Ripley pumps the slide on her grenade launcher.  She
        fires.  Pumps and fires again.  Four times.  The
        grenades punch deep into the egg sac and EXPLODE,
        ripping it open from within.  Eggs are tons of gelatinous
        matter pour across the chamber floor.  The Queen goes
        berserk, SCREECHING like some psychotic steam whistle.
        Ripley lays about her with the flamethrower, igniting
        everything in sight with an insane fury.  Eggs shrivel
        in the inferno, and figures of warriors and drones
        vanish in frenzied thrashing.  Over all is the Queen's
        shrieking as she struggles in the flames.  Two
        warriors emerge from the boiling smoke, closing on
        her.  She pulls the trigger...an empty click.  DIGITAL
        COUNTER flashing crimson zeroes.  She drops the
        magazine, grabs another from her belt, rams it home
        and OPENS UP.

        The creatures vanish in rapid-fire flashes.  Ripley

        backs away, venting her terror in a sustained orgy
        of fire as she blasts everything that moves in one
        long eye-searing expenditure of energy.  Then she
        dashes into the catacombs, navigating by sheer primal
        instinct.

        INT. CATACOMBS                                          176

        Ripley runs, blindly, with panting intensity verging
        on hysteria.  Impressions crash upon her...the maze
        blurring by, sirens howling, the station rocking with
        explosions, emergency lights flashing, steam blasting,
        red-hot steel hissing.  Reality itself is reduced to
        a concussive series of strobelike instants of
        relentless forward motion.

        She sees one of the flares she dropped and turns.
        Sees another, sprinting toward it as the foundations
        of the world shake.

        INT. EGG CHAMBER                                        177

        Lashing in a frenzy, the QUEEN DETACHES FROM THE EGG
        SAC, ripping away and dragging torn cartilage and
        tissue behind it.  SEEN DIMLY THROUGH swirling smoke,
        it rises on its powerful legs and steps forward.

        INT. CATACOMBS - CORRIDOR                               178-
                                                                179

        Ripley uses the flamethrower ahead of her, firing
        bursts of pulse-rifle fire down side corridors at
        indistinct shapes and shadows.  The weapon is empty
        when she reaches the freight elevators.  A mass of
        debris, falling down the shaft from a higher level,
        has demolished the life cage she descended in.  She
        slams the control for the other cage and hears the
        sound of the LIFT MOTOR'S WHINE as it begins its
        slow descent from several levels up.  AN ENRAGED
        SCREECH ECHOES in the corridor.  Ripley sees a
        silhouette moving in the smoke...a glistening black
        shape which FILLS THE CORRIDOR TO THE CEILING...THE
        QUEEN.  Her last cartridge is reading zeroes.  The
        flamethrower sputters uselessly when she tries that.
        The grenades are gone.  Ripley drops the weapon and
        looks up the shaft to the descending lift...then at
        the approaching FIGURE.  The elevator won't be in time.
        She runs to a ladder set in the wall as a horrendous
        screech beats in her ears.  She scrambles up the
        rungs.

        INT. SECOND LEVEL                                       180

        Ripley struggles up through a narrow hatch, Newt
        clinging to her.  She dives aside as a POWERFUL
        BLACK ARM shoots up through the opening, its
        razor claws slamming into the grille-floor inches
        from her.  Looking down through the grille she
        sees the great horrifying jaws directly below her,
        wet and leering.  She scrambles up, running, as
        the grille-floor lifts and buckles behind her
        with the titanic force of the creature below.
        It hurls itself with insane ferocity against the
        metal, pacing her from below as she runs.


        INT. STAIRWELL                                          181

        Ripley reaches an open-grid emergency stairwell and
        sprints upward.  It rocks and shudders with the
        station's death throes.

                                  VOICE
                   You now have two minutes
                   to reach minimum safe
                   distance.

        INT. CORRIDOR - ELEVATORS                               182-
                                                                183

        The lift reaches bottom, the doors rolling open.
        The Queen turns and freezes, as if contemplating
        the open lift cage.

        INT. STAIRWELL                                          184

        Ripley stumbles, smashing her knees against the
        metals stairs.  As she rises she hears the LIFT
        MOTORS start up.  Looking down through the lattice
        work of the station she sees the life cage start
        ominously upward.  She knows there is only one
        explanation for that.  She runs on, the stairwell
        becoming a crazy whirl around her.

        EXT. LANDING PLATFORM                                   185

        Ripley, with Newt still clinging to her, slams
        through the door opening onto the platform.
        Through wind-whipped streamers of smoke she
        sees...THE SHIP IS GONE.

                                  RIPLEY
                   BISHOP!

        Her shouts become inarticulate screams of hatred,
        outrage at the final betrayal.  She scans the sky.
        Nothing.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (hysterical)
                   BISHOP!

        Newt is sobbing.

        The lift rises ponderously INTO VIEW.  Ripley turns,
        backing away from the doors toward the railing.  There
        is no place to run to on the platform.  EXPLOSIONS

        detonate in the complex far below and huge fireballs
        swell upward through the machinery.  The platform bucks
        wildly.  Nearby a cooling tower collapses with a
        THUNDEROUS ROAR and the SHRIEK OF RENDING STEEL.  More
        EXPLOSIONS, one after another, rocketing up from below.
        Ripley stares transfixed as the lift stops.  The
        safety cage parts.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to Newt; low)
                   Close your eyes, baby.

        The lift doors begin to open.  A glimpse of the
        apparition within.

        ANGLE ON RIPLEY AND NEWT  as the drop-ship RISES RIGHT
        BEHIND THEM, its hovering jets roaring.

                                  VOICE
                   You now have thirty seconds to
                   reach...

        Ripley leaps for the loading boom projecting down from
        the cargo bay and it raises them into the ship.  A
        TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION RIPS THROUGH THE COMPLEX nearby,
        slamming the ship sideways.  Its extended landing legs
        foul in a tangle of conduit, grinding with a hideous
        squeal of metal on metal.

        INT./EXT. DROP-SHIP - STATION                           186-
                                                                187

        Ripley leaps into a seat with Newt, cradling her.  Begins
        strapping in.  Bishop wrestles with the controls.  The
        landing legs retract, ripping free.  Ripley slams her
        seat harness latches home.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Punch it, Bishop!

        The entire lower level of the station disappears in a
        fireball.  The air vibrates with intense heat waves and
        concussion.  The drop-ship engines fire.  Ripley is
        slammed back in her seat.  The ship vaults out and up,
        Bishop standing it on its tail, pouring on the gees.
        Ripley and Newt see everything shake into a blur.

        EXT. STRATOSPHERE                                       188

        The drop-ship lunges up and out of the cloud layer into
        the clear high night.  Below, the clouds light up from
        beneath from horizon to horizon.

        A SUN HOT DOME OF ENERGY bursts up through the cloud
        layer, WHITING OUT THE FRAME.  The tiny ship is slammed
        by the shockwave, tossed forward...and climbs, scorched
        but functioning, toward the stars.

        INT. DROP-SHIP                                          189

        Ripley and Newt watch the blinding glare fade away and
        they sit, wide-eyed, trembling, realizing they are
        finally and truly safe.  Newt starts to cry quietly,
        and Ripley strokes her hair.

                                  RIPLEY
                   It's okay, baby.  We made it.  It's
                   over.

        INT. SULACO CARGO LOCK - IN ORBIT - LATER               190

        The scorched and battered ship once again sits in its
        drop-bay, steam blasting from cooling vents beside the
        engine.  Rotating clearance lights sweep the dark chamber
        hypnotically.

        INT. DROP-SHIP                                          191

        Bishop stands behind Ripley as she kneels beside a
        comatose Hicks.

                                  BISHOP
                   I gave him a shot, for the pain.
                   We'll need to get a stretcher to
                   cart him up to medical.

        Ripley nods and, picking up Newt, precedes Bishop down
        the aisle to the loading ramp.

                                  BISHOP
                   I'm sorry if I gave you a scare
                   but that platform was just becoming
                   too unstable...

        INT. CARGO LOCK - DROP-SHIP                             192

        Bishop continues as they move down the ramp.

                                  BISHOP
                   I had to circle and hope things
                   didn't get too rough to take you
                   off.

        Ripley turns to him, stopping partway down the ramp.
        She puts her hand on his shoulder.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You did okay, Bishop.

                                  BISHOP
                   Well, thanks, I --

        He notices a tiny innocuous drop of liquid splash onto the
        ramp next to his shoe.  SSSSSS.  Acid.  SOMETHING BURSTS
        FROM HIS CHEST, spraying Ripley with milklike android blood.
        It is the razor-sharp scorpion TAIL of the alien QUEEN.
        Driven right through him from behind.  Bishop thrashes,
        seizing the protruding section of tail in his hands, as is
        slowly lifts him off the deck.  Above them the Queen
        glowers from its place of concealment among the hydraulic
        mechanisms inside one landing-leg bay.  It blends perfectly
        with the machinery until it begins to emerge.  Seizing
        Bishop in two great hands it rips him apart and flings him
        aside, shredded, like a doll.  It descends slowly to the
        deck, the rotating lights glistening across its shiny black
        limbs, dripping acid and rage.  Still smoking where Ripley
        half-fried it.  The Queen is huge, powerful...and very
        pissed off.  It descends slowly, its six limbs unfolding in
        inhuman geometries.

        Ripley moves with nightmarish slowness herself, staring
        hypnotized...terrified to break and run.  She lowers Newt
        to the deck, never taking her eyes off the creature.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to Newt)
                   Go!

        Newt runs for cover.  The Alien drops to the deck, pivoting
        toward the motion.  Ripley waves her arms, decoying.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Here!

        Without warning it moves like lightning, straight at her.
        Ripley spins, sprinting, as the creature leaps for her.
        Its feet slam, echoing, on the deck behind her.  She clears
        a door.  Hits the switch.  It WHIRRS closed.  BOOM.  The
        Alien hits a moment later.

        INT. DARK CHAMBER                                       193

        Ripley moves ferret-quick among dark, unrecognizable
        machines.

        VARIOUS ANGLES  VERY TIGHT ON what she is doing...her feet
        going into stirruplike mechanisms.  Velcro straps
        fastened over them.  Fingers stabbing buttons in a sequence.
        Her hand closing on a complex grip-control.  The HUM of
        powerful motors.  The WHINE of hydraulics.

        INT. CARGO LOCK                                         194

        The Queen turns its attention from the doors to Newt as
        the little girl crawls into a system of trenchlike
        service channels which cross the deck.  The channels are
        covered by steel grillework and barely big enough for her
        to crawl through.

        INT. CHANNEL                                            195

        Newt scurries like a rabbit as the looming figure of the
        Alien appears above, seen through the bars.  A section of
        grille is ripped away behind her.  She scrambles
        desperately.  Another section is ripped away right at her
        heels.  Light pouring in.  The next will be right above
        her.

        INT. CARGO LOCK                                         196

        The Queen spins at the sound of door motors behind her.
        The parting doors REVEAL an inhuman silhouette standing
        there.

        Ripley steps out, WEARING TWO TONS OF HARDENED STEEL.
        THE POWER LOADER.  Like medieval armor with the power of
        a bulldozer.  She takes a step...the massive foot
        CRASH-CLANGS to the deck.  She takes another, advancing.

        Ripley's expression is one you hope you'll never see...
        Hell hath no fury like that of a mother protecting her
        child and that primal, murderous rage surges through her
        now, banishing all fear.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Get away from her, you bitch!

        The Queen SCREECHES pure lethality and leaps.

        WALLOP!  A roundhouse from one great hydraulic arm catches
        it on its hideous skull and slams it into a wall.  It
        rebounds into a massive backhand.  CRASH!  It goes
        backward into heavy loading equipment.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (screaming)
                   Come on!

        The Queen emerges as a blur of rage, lashing with
        unbelievable fury.  The battle is joined.

        Claws swipe, tail lashes.  Ripley parries with radical
        swipes of the steel forks.  They circle in a whirling
        blur, demolishing everything in their path.  The cavernous
        chamber echoes with nightmarish sounds...WHINE, CRASH,
        CLANG, SCREECH.

        They lock in a death embrace. Ripley closes the forks,
        crushing two of the creature's limbs.  It lashes and
        writhes with incredible fury, coming within inches of her
        exposed body.  She lifts it off the ground.  The hind
        legs rip at her, slamming against the safety cage, denting
        it in.  The striking teeth extend almost a meter from
        inside its fanged maw, shooting between the crash-bars.
        She ducks and the teeth slam into the seat cushion
        behind her dead in a spray of drool.  Yellow acid foams
        down the hydraulic arms toward her.  The creature rips
        at high-pressure hoses.  Purple hydraulic fluid sprays
        ...machine blood mixing with alien blood.  They topple,
        off balance.  The Queen pins her.  Ripley hits a switch.
        The power loader's CUTTING TORCH flares on, directly in
        the thing's face.  They roll together, over the lip of
        a RECTANGULAR PIT, A VERTICAL LOADING AIRLOCK.

        INT. LOADING LOCK                                       197

        They crash together four meters below, twisted in the
        loader's wreckage.  The Alien shrieks, pinned.

        Ripley pulls her arm out of the controls of the loader
        and claws toward a panel of airlock actuating buttons.
        She slaps the red "INNER DOOR OVERRIDE" and latches the
        "HOLD" locking-key down.  A KLAXON begins to sound.  She
        hits "OUTER DOOR OPEN" and there is a hurricane shriek of
        air as the doors on which they are lying separate,
        REVEALING the infinite pit of stars, below.

        All this time the Alien has been lashing at her in a
        frenzy and she has been parrying desperately in the
        confined space.  The airlock becomes a wind tunnel,
        blasting and buffetting her as she struggles to unstrap
        from the loader.  The air of the vast ship howls past her
        into space as she claws her way up a service ladder.

        INT. CARGO BAY                                          198

        Newt screams as the hurricane airstream sucks her across
        the floor toward the airlock.   Bishop, torn virtually in
        two, his pastalike internal organs whipped by the wind,
        grips a stanchion and reaches desperately for Newt as she
        slides past him.  He catches her arm and hangs on as she
        dangles, doll-like, in the airblast.

        INT. LOADING LOCK                                       199

        The Alien seizes Ripley's ankle.  She locks her arms
        around a ladder rung, feels them almost torn out of
        their shoulder sockets.

        The door opens farther, all of space yawning below.  The
        loader tumbles clear, falling away.  It drags the Alien,
        still clutching one of Ripley's lucky hi-tops, into the
        depths of space.  Its SHRIEK fades, it gone.

        With all her strength Ripley fights the blasting air,
        crawling over the lip of the inner doorway.  She releases
        the OVERRIDE from a second panel.  The inner doors close.
        The turbulent air eddies and settles.

        She lies on her back, drained of all strength.  Gasping
        for breath.  Weakly she turns her head, seeing Bishop
        still holding Newt by the arm.  Encrusted with his own
        vanilla milkshake blood.  Bishop gives her a small, grim
        smile.

                                  BISHOP
                   Not bad for a human.

        He winks.

        Ripley crosses to Newt.

                                  NEWT
                          (weakly)
                   Mommy...Mommy?

                                  RIPLEY
                   Right here, baby.  Right here.

        Ripley hugs her desperately.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           200

        Ripley limps along the corridor, carrying Newt on her hip.
        The ship's systems hum comfortingly.  Newt's head rests
        on her shoulder.

                                  NEWT
                   Are we going to sleep now?

                                  RIPLEY
                   That's right.

                                  NEWT
                   Can we dream?

                                  RIPLEY
                   Yes, honey.  I think we both can.

        HOLD ON THEM AS they recede down the long straight
        corridor.

                                                         FADE OUT

   
                               THE END
