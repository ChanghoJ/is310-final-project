## IS 310 Final Project Post!
==

The prolonged semester project is finally done! I was glad to present my final work on History by Frequency because this was my first project that is involve coding other than a statistic. Although I am currently heading for Information Sciences with a Data Science major, my experience before undergraduate was far less likely a STEM. I enjoyed reading an easy historical text that is related to Korea, mostly focusing on modern history, and enjoyed United States History as I learned from international high school in Seoul. Even after I became a freshman at the University of Oregon, I attend several history classes as an elective. Yes, my interest was and is about history, international relationships, and government. (But this does not mean I have professional knowledge, rather I just enjoyed it.) Then, after prolonged armed service and the COVID-19 pandemic, I transferred to here, the UIUC as an IS student. At first, my pathway (IS +DS) seemed not related to the history that I enjoyed, but in IS 310 and through the final project, I realized “data science does have a connection with humanities.”

At the first time of thinking about my final project, I had no idea what to do, but the meeting with Professor LeBlanc gave me an impression of the task of my final project. During the meeting with the professor, I shared my interest as the professor requested, and the interests were video games, history, and international relationships. With my interests reported, the professor shared with me some significant blog posts about history and text analysis. The blog posts are from The Pudding, one post, the world through the eyes of the US, about visualized country mentioned in NYT newspapers, and the other post, A brief history of the past 100 YEARS as told through the New York Times archives, about most mentioned words by years in history. Both articles inspired me to give a try measuring words within the text and showing them as a graph. After the meeting, I keep inspired by other readings from a class activity like Gendered Language in Teacher Reviews and Film Dialogue. Gendered Language in Teacher Reviews visualized how certain words are frequently mentioned by gender in both positive and negative ways, and Film Dialogue visualized and claimed that character dialog lengths are mostly male-dominated, only about 22% of films have female leading dialog (Anderson & Daniels, 2016; Schmidt, 2015). These articles have two shared features that influence my final project, which are the visualized frequency of words in different frames and analyzed raw data. The blog posts gave me enough impression about how to proceed with my final project.

Then, how did I reach the theme of my final project, “How was Korea mentioned in the Cold War?” As mentioned at the beginning, I enjoyed some historical content before, but in addition to my interest, I just felt wonder about “would the frequent words mentioned are differed by years for Korea during the Cold War” because I also heard the old stories from my grandparents and parents in back in days of the Cold War Korea. Not only the old folk tales but the Cold War era indeed still impacting me and other relatives today. My grandfather served in the air force for 30 years, my father served in the air force military police for short time, and I served in the army for about 1 and a half years. I had a chance to visit one of the watchtowers at the frontline as a tourist, and vast excluded areas are separating the north and the south by river, forest, landmines, and concrete bunkers. During the armed service, my unit often practiced Defense ready Condition (DEFCON) drill in the preparation for war with North Korea, from level 4 (caution) to level 1 (total war). Of course, the armed tension between the North and the South is far less likely to become a war today, but my curiosity about the mood of the Cold War becomes larger than before the armed service.

Ok, this is how I eventually decided to analyze text frequency on the journal articles during Cold War Korea. To accomplish my text analysis project, I needed to find news article datasets that are far back to the 1950s. Thankfully, Professor LeBlanc introduced the NYT API that contains news articles that I need for the time frame between the 1950s to 1991. 

- First, as we learned during the “Introduction to APIs” class, to call the old articles from NYT API, I needed to receive the API key for calling from the website. 

- Second, open the Python and import all the add-ons like pandas for using CSV files, requests for requesting data from a link, and NLTK for analyzing data as we learned from Introduction to Unstructured Data. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25918993/167911641-7d357fb5-da84-4e04-8939-eecc581ebeff.png)
