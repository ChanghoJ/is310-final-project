## Can Data Die? Concern of Privacy
====

When I wondering around data visualization posts during week 2, blog post "Can Data Die?" drew my attention. As many tasks and untilities are digitized, spread of 'data' becomes common such as illegal movie download from U-torrent (P2P), PDF scanned e-book, or video without consent. Of course, the main character of the post, Lena Forsén's picture actually spreaded by engineers who wanted to test image for their research, which eventaully engineers won lawsuit later against copyright owner, Playboy. The spread of image seems not problematic because of the lawsuit, but the privacy concern rises here. Lena Forsén herself want to be forgotten or retired both as the model and digital image. Despite of Lena Forsén's request, her image keep flourishing on the Internet as high as 2nd frequently in 2020, according to the data visualization of the post shows. The histogram in the post gave me a clear example of possible privacy violation in digitized society: Privacy to be forgotten from past, right to be forgotten.

According to teh Daniel Soloves' _Six General Types of Privacy_, one of six type of privacy is 'secrecy,' which hide unwanted information in a past by self (Soloves, 2008). In the other words, individual owner of information should have right to keep secret or stop prevailing of information. However, Lena Forsén's picture case is one example of failing the secrecy by digitization of spread. Personally, I think the histogram in the post did great job on showing the 'level' of controversy about the situation, for rather than just mentioning 'thousands, millions,' showing the histogram works better for comparing situation in number. To be honest, it is shocking to know that the usage of  Lena Forsén's picture increased to 2nd most during 2020 because old image from 1970s still, no, actually more frequently used in recent days. _Can Data Die?_ article gives me an impression of ethics needs to come along with digital humantiy tasks and power of visualization.
